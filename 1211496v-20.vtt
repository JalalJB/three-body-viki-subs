=Episode 20=

10
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.840
So since then, you've been
pursuing the Three-Body problem.

11
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.920
But Henri Poincare once said math isn't the way to solving that.

12
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.540
I had no idea who he was, although anyone in math should know him.

13
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.610
Still, I didn't want to idolize anyone or be idolized.

14
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.920
I continued despite what he said.

15
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.680
For what it's worth, he could be wrong.

16
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.040
Besides, I've created a new algorithm

17
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.430
that uses quantity to derive quality so that the fittest will survive.

18
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.520
And the combination left in the end will be the correct prediction

19
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.630
for the next configuration of the Three-Body.

20
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.460
That's an evolutionary algorithm.

21
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.190
Evolutionary algorithm. I didn't learn that term until later.

22
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.750
Its distinguishing feature lies in computing power.

23
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.150
It requires ultra-large amounts of it!

24
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.760
The thing is, the computers we have now aren't able to do so for the Three-Body Problem!p

25
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.230
Back then, I didn't even have a calculator.

26
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.140
All I had were blank ledgers and pencils.

27
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.470
You've only been here a few days and burned a dozen ledgers.

28
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.200
Could I have a few more, please?

29
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.560
Don't burn them in the incense burner.

30
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.530
There's too much smoke.

31
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.940
(Great Buddha's Hall)

32
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.630
I lost track of time,

33
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.990
calculating day after day...

34
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.570
Until one day,

35
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.810
Shen Yufei dashed into my room.

36
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.380
Who are you?

37
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.270
What are you doing?

38
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.930
Did you do this?

39
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.950
Are you solving the Three-Body Problem?

40
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.920
Answer me!

41
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.940
Was that how you met your wife?

42
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.020
That was special.

43
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.480
I wouldn't call a woman "special".

44
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.800
But what surprised me was that the math I used was unconventional,

45
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.390
and my derivations  didn't show all the work,

46
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.920
but she could tell what I was doing from a few pieces of used paper.

47
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.110
Clearly, she had unusual math talent.

48
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.510
She was devoted to that problem, too.

49
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.630
That's right.

50
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.740
She was just like me, or even more obsessed.

51
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.430
Unlike those who came to the temple

52
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.360
to pray and snap pictures here and there

53
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.590
and seemed to be numb and unenlightened,

54
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.220
Shen Yufei looked like an academic.

55
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.680
Your approach is unusual.

56
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.070
Very well.

57
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.750
You know, we've been searching for a method

58
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.720
to address this difficult problem with massive computation.

59
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.360
Of course, that would require an extremely powerful computer.

60
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.770
The truth is,

61
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.950
all the computers in the world combined wouldn't be enough.

62
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.390
This place is terrible.

63
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.440
There's nothing you can use.

64
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.720
But with my help, you can have access to supercomputers.

65
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.370
I can also give you a minicomputer

66
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.750
if you leave with me tomorrow.

67
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.100
You and me?

68
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.040
After she left,

69
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.940
I couldn't sleep

70
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.860
and went to take a walk in the yard where I saw Shen Yufei again.

71
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.050
Buddha, please help my Lord break away from misery.

72
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.020
Help whom?

73
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.830
Lord who?

74
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.850
"Buddha, please help my Lord..."

75
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.950
That doesn't make sense.

76
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.270
What she called "Lord" needs...

77
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.950
help from the Buddha?

78
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.160
Is her Lord in misery?

79
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.900
I don't know about religion, nor do I want to,

80
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.850
but I couldn't think of a weirder prayer.

81
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:24.830
I don't know why but that freaked me out.

82
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.870
What does it mean if one prayed to the Buddha to help another Lord?

83
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.030
Who did that?

84
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.920
The woman who asked me to leave with her.

85
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.940
Let me think.

86
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.000
I can only think of one possibility.

87
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.280
That Lord of hers is real.

88
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.180
Then, as is the Buddha?

89
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.170
I'm sorry if I sound rude.

90
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.870
Like I said, you don't understand Buddhism.

91
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.630
The way the Buddha exists is beyond your cognition.

92
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.260
But you can understand that of her Lord.

93
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.480
Do you know what I'm saying?

94
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.000
Right, Buddhism isn't for everyone.

95
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.550
I can't tell you more.

96
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.320
All I can say is do not go with her.

97
00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.020
May I ask why?

98
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.120
It's just a hunch that she's hiding something

99
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.100
that the two of us can't possibly imagine.

100
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.080
Still, you left with her anyway.

101
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.010
I couldn't stay in the temple forever.

102
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:51.030
Over the next few years,
I was living my dream life.

103
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.480
Shen Yufei fulfilled her promise.

104
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.120
I had a minicomputer and
a comfortable environment.

105
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.440
I went abroad several times
to use supercomputers, not time-sharing,

106
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.030
but having the whole CPU to myself.

107
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.070
All that was expensive.

108
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.270
She was rich and I got used to it,

109
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.030
although I didn't know
where her money came from.

110
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.750
Then you two got married?

111
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.910
Sort of.

112
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.370
For mutual convenience, she said.
We both had things to do.

113
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.630
The following years
could be summarized into one single day.

114
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.790
In that big house,
I didn't have to worry about anything.

115
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.840
I could focus on my calculation.
She never interfered with my life.

116
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.720
All we talked about every day
was the Three-Body Problem.

117
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.240
She said to keep her updated.

118
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.270
Do you know what she's been doing?

119
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.980
Well...

120
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.630
You mean the Frontiers of Science?
She's busy with that all the time.

121
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.840
There'd be tons of visitors sometimes.

122
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.840
That was really annoying.

123
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.220
Didn't she ask you to join them?

124
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.120
You must be joking.

125
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.120
Why bother?

126
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.840
We're already married.

127
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.240
Besides, for someone like me, you think
I care about other things other than my work?

128
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.440
Of course not.

129
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.030
Wei Cheng,
your method can be a breakthrough.

130
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.480
A large group of scientists
tried the approximation approach

131
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.390
for a stable solution
to the Three-Body Problem.

132
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.200
Eventually, they found
under appropriate initial conditions,

133
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.480
the three bodies would chase each other
around a fixed figure-eight curve.

134
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.360
After that,

135
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.390
others were keen to find
such special stable configurations.

136
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.410
But so far,
only three or four have been discovered.

137
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.460
I believe your method

138
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.200
can turn out a lot more.

139
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.790
I wouldn't call them a lot
as I've only found over 100.

140
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.720
Still,
my goal is to build a mathematical model

141
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.910
so that when given

142
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.320
any initial configuration
with known vectors,

143
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.200
the model can precisely predict all
subsequent motions of the Three-Body System.

144
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.980
That's also Shen Yufei's goal.

145
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.130
Yet with my breakthrough

146
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.260
comes danger.

147
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.270
You went on and on.

148
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.790
Now, I get it.

149
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.940
Can you tell us
why you went to the police?

150
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.030
Pan Han,

151
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.080
he threatened me.

152
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.510
He said
if I didn't stop my calculation,

153
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.270
he'd kill me!

154
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.460
Pan Han?

155
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.870
Who's he?

156
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.270
How old is the guy?

157
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.910
He's with the Frontiers of Science,
probably in his 30s.

158
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.750
He's... a biologist, I guess.

159
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.670
When and how did he threaten you?

160
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.390
A few days ago.

161
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.830
(You know,
that punk brought a real gun)

162
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.600
(and shot my computer.)

163
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.670
No, it's not saved!
(I was scared to death.)

164
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.700
It's gone!

165
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.620
(And then)

166
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.100
(in the middle of that night,)

167
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.600
(when I was half-asleep,
I sensed something cold)

168
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.150
(sliding on my neck in a uniform motion.)

169
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.840
(I opened my eyes...)

170
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.840
I... I'll stop. I'll quit. I'll quit.

171
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.700
(And I saw Shen Yufei.)

172
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.150
I almost died of fright.

173
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.120
What's so frightening about
seeing your wife

174
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.240
in the middle of the night?

175
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.360
That is if she didn't hold a knife.

176
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.870
But what puzzled me was that

177
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.360
she also threatened me,
saying she'd kill me if I stopped.

178
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.440
I felt conflicted.

179
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.840
I thought I'd die either way!

180
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.750
What were her exact words?

181
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.510
She said...

182
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.630
If you succeed,
you'll be the savior of the world.

183
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.080
If you stop now, you'll be a sinner.

184
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.510
If someone were to save
or destroy the human race,

185
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:55.120
then your possible contribution or sin
would be exactly twice as much as his.

186
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.080
I'm confused. What does she mean
by exactly twice as much?

187
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.530
I had the same question.

188
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.670
- Why would it be twice?
- Continue your work.

189
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.130
Otherwise,

190
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.410
you're useless to this world,

191
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.650
and I'll kill you.

192
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.270
The whole model

193
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.460
and the files for sharing are all in it.

194
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.130
You can test and verify my model.

195
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.980
Are you entrusting it to me?

196
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.390
Either you or Shen Yufei.

197
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.630
(Professor Wang,
I noticed you the first time you came.)

198
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.320
(You're a good man,)

199
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.720
(a man with a sense of responsibility.)

200
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.340
That's why

201
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.100
I suggest you stay away from this.

202
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.050
The world is about to change.

203
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.440
All we can do is try to
live out the rest of our life.

204
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.010
Don't worry about other things.
It's useless anyway.

205
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.940
Why do I feel
you know more than you let on?

206
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.070
You know, I'm smarter than I look.

207
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.370
We were together every day.
It's impossible to not know a thing.

208
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.600
Why didn't you tell the police earlier?

209
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.960
How should I put it?

210
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.950
With all due respect,

211
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.510
cops are a joke.

212
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.550
Even God can't do anything.

213
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:05.550
The human race has reached the point
where their prayers can't be heard.

214
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.850
All that is because God

215
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.810
and her so-called Lord

216
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.570
are struggling themselves.

217
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.240
It's me.

218
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.750
You know where Wei Cheng is?

219
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.750
Yes.

220
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.880
How's his calculation going?

221
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.700
He's built the model.

222
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.790
Now, we can test it in the game?

223
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.920
Are you coming to get him?

224
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.510
Maybe after the game.

225
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.160
Give him the phone.

226
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.740
OK. One sec.

227
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.610
It's for you.

228
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.460
Listen, do not drink.

229
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.070
I'll drop you off
at the Nanomaterial Center

230
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.640
for you to play the game
and test Wei Cheng's model.

231
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.350
Then I'll go see Shen Yufei
and grab a bite on the way.

232
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.540
- Don't forget about Pan Han.
- No worries. Xu Bingbing will be on it.

233
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.660
(National Center
for Nanoscience and Technology)

234
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.660
You must be Einstein.

235
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.440
No, you're mistaken.

236
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.790
I'm not him.

237
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.030
I'm a lost soul abandoned by God.

238
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.400
Who are you?

239
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.790
I'm Copernicus.

240
00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.550
Distinguished Copernicus,
I'd appreciate it if you could stop

241
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.640
for some Mozart.

242
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.720
Then I'll be able to afford lunch.

243
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.790
The Tri-Solar Syzygy
destroyed everything,

244
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.350
including the great pyramid
over there.

245
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.110
The United Nations Headquarters
is there now.

246
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.380
Do we have a deal?

247
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.810
Here comes the sun.

248
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.790
Here it is.

249
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.270
As the sun rises,
no more Mozart for me,

250
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.000
but this time, I got lucky, you know?

251
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.880
No need to say goodbye to music early.

252
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.310
A giant sun?

253
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.090
Is another destruction coming?

254
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.290
Silvery shine.

255
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.530
Almost no heat.

256
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.270
What is that?

257
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.660
Is it the moon?

258
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.880
A giant moon?

259
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.610
How come I've never seen it before
in the game?

260
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.030
Are you aware of the Great Rip?

261
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.440
The Great Rip?

262
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.030
What is that?

263
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:42.830
The old me, the old civilization,
the old universe, all is too painful to recall!

264
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.790
What changed you?

265
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.980
The Great Rip?

266
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.270
Of course not!

267
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.640
No one could see it alive.

268
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.180
It was all too overwhelming!

269
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.350
All our efforts were squashed.

270
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.460
God has given up on us!

271
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.880
Let's hope he won't do the same to you,

272
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.530
though I don't have much faith in that.

273
00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.720
The model you, Newton,
and the others created in the East

274
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.240
with the help
of the human-formation computer

275
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.350
was quite close to being correct.

276
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.270
But that tiny little gap
was insurmountable

277
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:21.030
for Newton and the others.

278
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.110
And your relativity fits right into it.

279
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.070
No.
I've always believed that without me,

280
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.830
others would've discovered
special relativity eventually,

281
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.440
but general relativity is different.

282
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.640
To be specific,
the bit that Newton lacked

283
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.960
was the effect on planetary orbit

284
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.200
from the gravitational perturbation
described by general relativity.

285
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.880
The error caused by it was small,

286
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.000
but its impact on the results
of the computation was fatal.

287
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.200
True. Adding the correction factor
for the perturbation

288
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.920
to the classical equations
would get the right mathematical model.

289
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.030
The amount of computing power required far
exceeds what you accomplished in the East,

290
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.200
but it's easily provided
by modern computers.

291
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.440
Have the results of observation
been confirmed by astronomy?

292
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.030
If so, do you think I'd be here?

293
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.790
Although aesthetically speaking,

294
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.680
I'm right and the universe is wrong.

295
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.770
God left me
and then others followed suit.

296
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.770
Professor Wang.

297
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.420
Dr. Shen.

298
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.740
Dr. Shen,

299
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.680
this is Wei Cheng's model.

300
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.310
Do you think it'll work?

301
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.640
If not, then math, too,

302
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.790
(The Three-Body Problem Model)
isn't the solution to the problem.

303
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.640
The Pendulum Initiation Ceremony
is about to begin.

304
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.680
Let's go.

305
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.750
I saw the pendulums
of the Warring States Period.

306
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.790
They were to hypnotize the Sun God.

307
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.110
The present civilization
has evolved to the level

308
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.000
where theology and myth
are no longer needed for a solution.

309
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.200
Once it starts swinging,
it'll wipe out all that we've done.

310
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.720
This is our last hope.

311
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.830
Does it mean your Lord
will be out of misery?

312
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.000
As will all of us.

313
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.070
(Please attend on time.)

314
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.400
(The Pendulum Initiation Ceremony
is about to begin.)

315
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.110
(Please attend on time.)

316
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:23.290
Copernicus, I remember you
who've gone through five eras!

317
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.200
Please meet
the Secretary General of the UN.

318
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
Greetings.

319
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.750
Greetings.

320
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.590
Did you see such things
back in the Warring States Period?

321
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.750
I did.

322
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.440
But why are we
building another one now?

323
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.350
It's a monument for Trisolaris,
as well as a tombstone.

324
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.200
A tombstone? For whom?

325
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.030
For an aspiration, a striving that lasted
through almost 200 civilizations:

326
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.310
the effort to solve
the Three-Body Problem,

327
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.790
to find the pattern
in the movements of the suns.

328
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.830
As of now, it's completely over.

329
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.880
We're here to help.

330
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.900
I brought a mathematical model
that can solve the Three-Body Problem.

331
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.000
It's a brand-new algorithm.

332
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.510
Maybe it'll work.

333
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.590
Out of respect for your reputation,

334
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.660
I'll have my science advisor
take a look.

335
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.640
An evolutionary algorithm?

336
00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.000
Whoever created that is a genius.

337
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.400
It requires superior math skills
and incredible imagination.

338
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.550
Has someone already
put together such a model?

339
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.510
Yes. There are dozens.

340
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.200
Over half of them are better than yours.

341
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.830
Did they work?

342
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.880
We've got conclusive proof
that the Three-Body Problem

343
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.140
is unsolvable.

344
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.030
It's just like we guessed long ago
that the Three-Body System is chaotic.

345
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.440
Tiny perturbations
can be endlessly amplified.

346
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.530
Its patterns of movement essentially
can't be mathematically predicted.

347
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.440
If even a simple arrangement
like the Three-Body System

348
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.510
is unpredictable chaos,

349
00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.030
how can we have any faith in discovering
the laws of the complicated universe?

350
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:06.010
God has turned his back on Trisolaris.

351
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.350
This civilization
seems to be quite advanced.

352
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:18.440
Yes. We've mastered nuclear power
and reached the Information Age.

353
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.270
Then there's still hope.

354
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.590
When civilization reaches a new high,
even if it's impossible to know

355
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.960
the pattern of the suns' movements,
we can survive the Chaotic Eras

356
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.480
by protecting ourselves
against the devastating catastrophes.

357
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.550
Those before you thought so, too.

358
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.400
That was one of the motivating forces
pushing Trisolaran Civilization

359
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.790
to bounce back over and over.

360
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:46.400
But the moon made us realize
how naive that idea was.

361
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.000
This is probably the first time
you've seen this moon.

362
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.350
Actually, it's about a quarter
of the size of our planet.

363
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.030
It's no longer a moon,

364
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:02.310
but a companion to our world
resulting from the Great Rip.

365
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.480
The Great Rip?

366
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.000
What exactly is that?

367
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.420
The disaster
that killed the last civilization.

368
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:16.240
Compared with previous civilizations,
it had ample warning of the disaster.

369
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.680
Based on surviving records,
the astronomers of Civilization No. 191

370
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:24.420
detected early on a frozen flying star.

371
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.070
Meaning it stopped moving?

372
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.200
Yes.

373
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.720
A frozen flying star boded ill for several
Trisolaran Civilizations.

374
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.440
When a flying star or a distant sun

375
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.640
seems to come to a complete stop
against the background starfield...

376
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.400
It'll lead to three possibilities.

377
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.160
First, the suns and the planet are moving
at the same speed in the same direction.

378
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.590
Second,
they're moving apart from each other.

379
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.000
The last and the worst one is...

380
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.400
The suns are moving toward the planet!

381
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.920
Is that what you call the Great Rip?

382
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.160
Yes.

383
00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.440
The people of Civilization No. 191
stood on the ground,

384
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.790
gazing up helplessly
at the three frozen flying stars

385
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:10.070
and the three suns swooping down
on their world.

386
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.420
Follow me.

387
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.070
Here it is.

388
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:25.350
This corridor was built
to honor those unforgettable memories.

389
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:29.750
As one of the suns was moving,
its outer gaseous layer became visible.

390
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.550
In the middle of a tranquil night,

391
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:35.270
the flying star
suddenly turned into a blazing sun.

392
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:40.880
After 30 hours or so, the other two suns
also appeared successively.

393
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.110
By the time the last flying star
turned into a sun,

394
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.960
the first sun had already swept past the planet
at extremely close range.

395
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.270
Right after that, the other two suns

396
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.640
swept past Trisolaris
at even closer ranges.

397
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.550
The tidal forces imposed on the planet
by the three suns

398
00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.310
all exceeded the Roche limit.

399
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:04.030
In that case,
the planet would be torn to pieces.

400
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:09.270
The first sun shook the deepest
geological structure of the planet.

401
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.920
The second sun
tore open a great rift in it

402
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.640
that went straight to the core.

403
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.350
The third sun
ripped the planet into two pieces.

404
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.830
That's the smaller piece.

405
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.750
With ruins from
Civilization No. 191 on it, it is, however,

406
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.030
a lifeless world.

407
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.750
After the planet was torn apart,
the two irregularly shaped pieces

408
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.640
returned to spherical form
under self-gravitation.

409
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.550
The dense, searing planetary core material
gushed to the surface.

410
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:42.270
When that happened,
the oceans would boil over the lava.

411
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.550
The continents would melt.

412
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.480
As they collided, the ground would become
as soft as the ocean.

413
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.160
You're right.

414
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.920
Massive mountains of tens of thousands
of meters could rise in an hour

415
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.530
and disappear just as quickly.

416
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.160
The two pieces were still connected
by streams of molten lava

417
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.440
that coalesced into
a space-spanning river.

418
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:15.350
Then the lava cooled,
turning into rings around the planets.

419
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.750
Due to perturbations from the planets,
the rings were unstable.

420
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.030
The rocks that formed them fell back

421
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.480
to the surface
in a rain of giant stones for centuries.

422
00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.270
That was hellish.

423
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.160
The ecological destruction
caused by this catastrophe

424
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.550
was the severest in all of history.

425
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.200
All life on the companion planet
went extinct,

426
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.640
and the mother planet almost became
a lifeless waste as well.

427
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.270
Unexpectedly,
the seeds of life sprouted again.

428
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.590
As the geology of the mother planet
settled down,

429
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.270
civilization reappeared
for the 192nd time.

430
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.510
This process took 90 million years.

431
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:56.310
Trisolaris's place in the universe
is even grimmer than we had imagined.

432
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.680
A recent astronomical discovery

433
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.160
has made us lose all hope
for the fate of Trisolaris.

434
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.830
Eventually, our planet will plunge into

435
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:08.740
the fiery sea of the sun.

436
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.270
Based on the remaining signs
in this stellar system,

437
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.550
we learned how the stars
and the planets were formed

438
00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.160
and discovered that in the distant past,

439
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.510
the Trisolaran Stellar System
once had 12 planets.

440
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.750
Yet, only this one remains.

441
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.160
All 11 of them have been destroyed?

442
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.480
Afraid so.

443
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.570
There's only one explanation.

444
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.960
The other 11 planets
have all been consumed

445
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.270
by the three suns with time.

446
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:46.880
Our world is
but the sole survivor of a Great Hunt.

447
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.680
Trisolaran Civilization
couldn't have been reborn 192 times

448
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.720
solely because of luck, right?

449
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.680
For all we know, that streak has ended.

450
00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.680
Also, further study shows
that the three stars are breathing.

451
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.110
They're breathing?

452
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.920
The gaseous outer layer of the suns
expands and contracts

453
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.530
over cycles lasting eons like breathing.

454
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.640
When the gaseous layer expands,
it can grow a dozen times thicker,

455
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.880
greatly increasing
the diameter of the sun.

456
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.590
It's like a giant mitt
that can catch planets more easily.

457
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.200
It's proven that in the long history
of the Trisolaran Stellar System,

458
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.160
every time the gaseous layers expanded,
one or two planets were consumed.

459
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.790
Scholars have predicted that
the next expansion will happen in

460
00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.880
1.5 to 2 million years.

461
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.070
We believed

462
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.440
all our efforts would be in vain.

463
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.310
God walked out on us.

464
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.550
We're the loneliest kids
in the universe.

465
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.960
(The Pendulum Initiation Ceremony
is about to begin.)

466
00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.510
(Please attend on time.)

467
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.960
They're going to activate the Pendulum.

468
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.830
Please join us to witness
this historical moment.

469
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.310
(The Pendulum Initiation Ceremony
is about to begin.)

470
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:05.740
(Please attend on time.)

471
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.750
- Humans are too insignificant.
- They are.

472
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.830
Life is too fragile
to survive in the vast universe.

473
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.830
That said, it's also great.

474
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:34.030
That's how Civilization No. 192
managed to germinate.

475
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:38.400
Thanks to you, I was able to see
how tenacious this civilization is.

476
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.780
With all hope gone,
tenacity could be a curse.

477
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.030
Somehow, I'm thinking of one person.

478
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.640
Who is it?

479
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.720
Yang Dong.

480
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.070
You get her desperation now?

481
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.400
I'm not sure.

482
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.400
But she was indeed special.

483
00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.920
Even when she knew our science
is hopeless, she didn't give up.

484
00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.960
She could've muddled along.

485
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.640
I don't know what happened to her.

486
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.790
Do you remember her suicide note?

487
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:10.030
"Physics has never existed
and will never exist."

488
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:14.850
That conclusion is more terrifying
than that of humans' existence.

489
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:22.200
Professor Wang, you're the chosen one
to fulfill your mission.

490
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.480
There's nothing else I can do.

491
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.250
I hope you can make a difference.

492
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.980
Dr. Shen...

493
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.440
We can't stay

494
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.680
in this terrible place anymore.

495
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.200
We can't

496
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.270
even if we want to.

497
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.160
We have no choice

498
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.790
but to gamble with the universe.

499
00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.000
How?

500
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.880
Leave the Trisolaran Stellar System
for the wide-open sea of stars.

501
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.940
We must find in the galaxy
a new livable habitat.

502
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.750
Activate the Pendulum!

503
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.960
(Activating the Pendulum.)

504
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.980
(Activating the Pendulum.)

505
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.920
Its period isn't stable,
but changing constantly.

506
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.510
When the giant moon is
on this side of the planet,

507
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:44.550
its gravity offsets that of the planet,
causing the pendulum to lose weight.

508
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.630
When it moves to the other side,
the gravity of the two is added

509
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.030
and its weight returns to that
before the Great Rip.

510
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.920
Look at it.

511
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.550
Isn't it like a gigantic metal fist,

512
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:02.590
swinging eternally against
the unfeeling universe?

513
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:07.510
Does it say the yearning for order
or the surrender to chaos?

514
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.630
That's its battle cry.

515
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.380
Trisolaris's indomitable battle cry!

516
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.610
Good luck!

517
00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.400
(451 years later,
Civilization No. 192 was destroyed)

518
00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.000
(by the fiery flames of twin suns.)

519
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.920
(It had reached the Atomic
and the Information Ages.)

520
00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.550
(Civilization No. 192 was
a milestone in Trisolaris.)

521
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.800
(It finally proved that
the Three-Body Problem had no solution.)

522
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.510
(It gave up the useless effort
that had lasted through 191 cycles)

523
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.550
(and set the course
for future civilizations.)

524
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.230
(Thus,
the goal of Three-Body has changed.)

525
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.710
(The new goal is: Head for the stars;
find a new home.)

526
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.610
(We invite you to log on again.)

527
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.130
Will tears give you a way out?

528
00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:03.500
You tried to use our math
to solve the Three-Body Problem.

529
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.690
Don't you find that juvenile?

530
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.280
You pitched the hypothesis
of the shooter and the farmer to others

531
00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.320
and blindly believed
those two-dimensional targets

532
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.000
could predict
the trajectory of the bullets.

533
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.690
Wei Cheng is a genius,
born for the Three-Body Problem.

534
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.590
His calculation tells me

535
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.570
that it can't be solved.

536
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.940
That result

537
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.760
also concludes my life.

538
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.700
I've told you more than once

539
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.170
that everything you've done
is useless.

540
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.670
Were the problem solved,

541
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:49.190
we wouldn't hear the Lord's voice.

542
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.130
Your less advanced civilization
provides zero chance of success.

543
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.630
You can't redeem Lord,

544
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.760
nor does it need your redemption.

545
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.710
Too bad,

546
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:05.300
it's too late for you to see that.

547
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.500
The trial failed,

548
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.230
but it didn't break me.

549
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.960
What I've seen in the game

550
00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.100
is unimaginable for humans.

551
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:23.050
I saw how the tidal power
rip the world into two,

552
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.260
how the ocean boil over lava,

553
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:30.000
and how the corona of the stars

554
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.570
devour one planet after another.

555
00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.570
It was dark

556
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.420
and ruthless.

557
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:43.360
Powerful as those forces seem,

558
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.380
they're tiny drops in the universe.

559
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:52.420
All those moments
will fade in desperation

560
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:56.650
like downpours drowned in the ocean.

561
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:01.500
Who are we to redeem Lord?

562
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:04.690
We know nothing about the universe.

563
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.020
I once accused you of using Lord
for your secret agenda.

564
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.820
Turns out, I'm doing the same.

565
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.440
Both the Adventists

566
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.780
and the Redemptionists

567
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.340
are selfish and greedy.

568
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.300
Humans are infinitely small.

569
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.780
We just want to feel important.

570
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.030
People have two sides just like a coin,

571
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.070
one good, the other bad.

572
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.010
Do you know which side to choose?

573
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.320
There are two planets:

574
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.840
one is checkered and broken;

575
00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.300
the other is stable and livable.

576
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:07.170
Are you going to stay where you are,
solving the unsolvable problem,

577
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.710
or find a new home?

578
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.500
We have to make a choice,

579
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.430
and as does Lord?

580
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.840
That game was to help you know

581
00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.920
and understand Lord,

582
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.010
but you thought you had to redeem it.

583
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.130
You're right.

584
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.730
We have a choice to make.

585
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.690
Now that we've heard Lord's voice,

586
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.500
you still don't get it?

587
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.420
It has made its choice, OK?

588
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:54.780
(5 Missed Calls)

589
00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.980
(Shi Calling)

590
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:09.780
What's up?

591
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.260
Excuse me.

592
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.030
What happened?

593
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.900
Captain Shi is over there.

594
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.780
A GSW to the head
damaged the brain and killed her.

595
00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.880
Did Wei Cheng's model succeed?

596
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.940
No.

597
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.230
He did it wrong?

598
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:31.460
His model has successfully proven
that there is no solution.

599
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.150
She must've been devastated.

600
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.860
She mentioned Yang Dong

601
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.420
and said she had been even more so.

602
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:52.190
We've requested the footage.

603
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.630
The camera at the door shows
at Shen Yufei's time of death,

604
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.440
only one person came here,
who was probably the last person she saw...

605
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.050
Give me the name!

606
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.940
Pan Han.
