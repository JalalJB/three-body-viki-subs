00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
â™ªTo the end of the dark forestâ™ª

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.100
â™ªThe wind is like a handâ™ª

â™ªWho is eager to fill his eyes

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
â™ªThe earth is no longer rotatingâ™ª

13

â™ªYou gave me a small universeâ™ª

â™ªIn the arms of the universeâ™ª

â™ªCalling humbly for
the vast space and timeâ™ª

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.200
At the moment, the hut was quiet.

20
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I could hear the sound of pen nib
scratching against paper,

21
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.400
and smell the fragrance of the sawdust.

22
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Since my father died,

23
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I hadn't felt relaxed
and experienced warmth for a long time.

24
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
- Take a look.
- Okay.

25
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.000
Thank you.

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.800
You're welcome.

27
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.800
Let me wash your dirty laundry.

28
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
No, no, no.

29
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.500
Don't bother.

30
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.700
You ladies work as hard as men
in the northern tree farm.

31
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.400
Just go home and take a rest.

32
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.000
We are to climb the mountain
tomorrow at 6:00 AM.

33
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.400
Wenjie.

34
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.600
Sorry.

35
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.500
Excuse me.

36
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.800
I'll return to the division headquarters
the day after tomorrow.

37
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.000
I'll report to the higher-ups about you.

38
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.100
Hopefully you'll be able
to get out of here.

39
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.100
No, thanks.

40
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.600
I find it quite nice here.

41
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.100
It's quiet.

42
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.900
Are you hiding away from something?

43
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.800
Bye.

44
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.700
(The annual selection of production
and construction model worker will soon begin.)

45
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.100
(Now, let's review)

46
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.800
(the speech of Comrade Wang Shengtian,
last year's model worker.)

47
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800
(Hello, dear comrades.)

48
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.200
(I'm honored to be selected as this year's production and construction model worker.)

49
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.600
(At work, I reflect on myself and
learn from my experience all the time.)

50
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.200
(I follow rules strictly.)

51
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.100
(I learn from the exemplars around me.)

52
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.600
(I keep in mind that the people have
unlimited power to create.)

53
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.300
(They can be organized and march towards the places and departments)

54
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.200
(where they can invest their efforts,
dig deeper and expand wider in production,)

55
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.600
(and perform welfare undertaking
that increasingly benefits themselves.)

56
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.600
(There's an old saying goes,
three men stick together,)

57
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.000
(dirt can be turned into gold.)

58
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.200
Get to work. Get to work.

59
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.600
Move, move, move. Come on.

60
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.000
â™ªWe are marching on a great roadâ™ª

61
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.600
â™ªSpirits high and fighting will strongâ™ª

62
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.400
â™ªThrough the stormâ™ª

63
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.940
Come on. Keep it going!
On my count!

64
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.040
One, two, one.

65
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.950
One, two, one.

66
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.040
Going all out!

67
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.070
Rise to the top!

68
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.950
Going all out!

69
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.560
Rise to the top!

70
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.680
This is it.

71
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.600
20 meters away
from the log drop point.

72
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.000
Keep it going, everybody.

73
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Ye Wenjie!

74
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.900
Ye Wenjie!

75
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.500
Stop.

76
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.400
Ye Wenjie, rush back to the company.

77
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.800
What happened?

78
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.300
I don't know.

79
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.300
But I feel like you might be in big trouble.

80
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.500
Just go.

81
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.000
Just drive.

82
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.300
Five meters in the reverse direction.
Got it?

83
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.500
What's in the sack?

84
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.600
â™ªIn the blue skyâ™ª

85
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.800
Ready? Begin.

86
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.000
â™ªIn the blue sky floats the white cloudâ™ª

87
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.600
â™ªUnder the white cloud gallops the horseâ™ª

88
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.000
Come in.

89
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.600
Comrade Ye.

90
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.000
This is Director Zhang
from political department.

91
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.600
He's here to do a survey.

92
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.200
Don't be afraid, though.

93
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.200
Just say what you know. Be honest, and be cooperative with Director Zhang.

94
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.900
Director Zhang.

95
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.100
You are Ye Wenjie?

96
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.000
Don't be nervous.
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

97
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I hope you can answer them with honesty.

98
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.000
Did you write the letter?

99
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800
(Revolutionary Masses)

100
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.200
Revolutionary Masses?

101
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.200
Did you write it?

102
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.700
No, it wasn't me.

103
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.200
But the crosscheck result shows
this is your handwriting.

104
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.400
Yes, it is.

105
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.500
But I'm only the copier.

106
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.300
For whom?

107
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.000
Say it.

108
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.300
Just come clean, quickly.

109
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.200
Umâ€¦

110
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
Director Zhang, I-I know her.

111
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.600
- She's just like this.
- Please take a seat.

112
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.500
Let me talk to her.

113
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.300
Hey, listen.

114
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.300
Ye, you never told me anything
that happened to you.

115
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.400
Butâ€¦ But we all know, right?

116
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.400
Commander told me a few days ago

117
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.300
that whatever bad things happened to you, you would just take it on yourself.

118
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.300
As your instructor, I know you.

119
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.000
You just don't want to get
someone else in trouble, do you?

120
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.500
About this, you can just tell Director Zhang everything you know with honesty, okay?

121
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.600
Let's talk it out,
and it'll be fine, you know?

122
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.400
Just tell Director Zhang.

123
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.500
Go on.

124
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.400
Speak.

125
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.900
Comrade Ye Wenjie.

126
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:32.200
You are aware how serious, and how special it is.

127
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.300
Do you know what it means?

128
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.800
Just speak.

129
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.800
A reporter came to the company
from last week.

130
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.000
The reporter's name
is Bai Mulin, right?

131
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.900
Ye Wenjie, are you aware
how serious the crime of slander is?

132
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.500
We have run a thorough investigation
on Comrade Bai Mulin.

133
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.600
All he did was
help you mail the letter.

134
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.100
He had no idea
what was in the letter.

135
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.200
Did he say that?

136
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.600
You don't believe me, huh?

137
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.300
Present yourself.

138
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.000
Is she the one?

139
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.800
Yes.

140
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:17.500
I believe that this book inspired you
to write the letter, right?

141
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.200
The book title is Silent Spring,
published in the western world in 1962.

142
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.000
Its publication
stirred the capitalist society.

143
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.100
(Silent Spring)
And this is the Chinese version.

144
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.800
It's the teaching material for internal reference, and is used as a negative example.

145
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.800
The higher-ups explicitly stated

146
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.800
that the book had a great negative impact.

147
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:54.000
The book adopts
the idealist conception of history,

148
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.500
and propagandizes the idea of doomsday.

149
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.400
It's seemingly environment-themed,

150
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.200
but its nature is to justify the corruption
and degeneration of capitalism.

151
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.600
It's rotten to its core!

152
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.300
The book isn't mine.

153
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.700
You stole it!

154
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.800
I didn't steal it.

155
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.000
Bai Mulin lent me the book.

156
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.000
Nonsense!

157
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.300
Nonsense!

158
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.600
I was assigned
to translate the book by the authority.

159
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.000
- I have the legal right to own this book.
- Control yourself.

160
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.700
I admit it is my fault
that I didn't keep the book properly.

161
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.700
But I didn't expect her to steal the book
when I was doing work.

162
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.400
You found the weapon
to harm socialism.

163
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.600
If I wasn't here, she would impute
all the responsibility to me.

164
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.700
she would impute
all the responsibility to me.

165
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.120
Ye Wenjie,

166
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.270
I have been nice to you, why would you lie? 
 (Assignments Lumbering Transportation Piling)

167
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.650
Why would you betray your comrades for personal interest?

168
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.130
All right. All right.

169
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.750
Enough.

170
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.200
Calm yourself down.

171
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.420
We have acquired enough information about this matter.

172
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.150
Alright.

173
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:50.420
Ye Wenjie, we have been treating you as humanely as possible.

174
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.270
I know that you have a lowly birth.

175
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.080
But we see you as one of us.

176
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.440
About your inclination of isolating yourself from the people and refusing to seek progress,

177
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.340
your instructor and I talked to you many times and tried to help you change.

178
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.920
But who would have thought that you'd make such a serious mistake?

179
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.010
I knew you inclined to not integrate into the collective,

180
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.650
but I didn't expect that your toxic thoughts were so deep-rooted.

181
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.900
Take a good look at yourself.

182
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.030
Take her to the division headquarters.

183
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:24.840
Don't stop the interrogation until she acknowledges her guilt.

184
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.120
Greetings, Representative Cheng.

185
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.010
Hold on a minute.

186
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.910
The room is so cold. Go get a stove.

187
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.450
Yes, sir.

188
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.480
I'm here representing the military control commission of the intermediate court.

189
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.590
My name is Cheng Lihua.

190
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.140
Nice to meet you.

191
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.820
Ye Wenjie.

192
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.110
Your hand is so cold.

193
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.580
We'll sit over there.

194
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.200
Let's have a good talk.

195
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.320
Come on.

196
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.070
You are young.

197
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.830
Younger than I thought.

198
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.440
Ye, how foolish of you.

199
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.570
Well, that's what young people do. 
 (Archive Folder)

200
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.680
The more you read, the more foolish you become.

201
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.080
But to be fair, everybody would make mistakes when they were young.

202
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.680
I made mistakes, too.

203
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.600
But our attitude remains the same. Don't feel stressed.

204
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.930
Acknowledge your mistake and correct it, and you can still contribute to the revolution.

205
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.450
Here, drink some hot water.

206
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.580
Warm yourself up.

207
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.350
(In relation to Ye Zhetaiâ€¦)

208
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.350
Here, sign this.

209
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.640
And we'll have a good conversation.

210
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.140
I'll be guiding you.

211
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.510
Ye, you can trust me.

212
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:30.720
I swear on my honor that your signature on the paper

213
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.100
will prove your attitude and stance.

214
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.880
Come on, sign it.

215
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.580
Okay?

216
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.590
Ye Wenjie, Representative Cheng only wants to help you.

217
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.510
She's been concerned about you these days.

218
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.890
Don't be unrepentant.

219
00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.410
Do you hear me?

220
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.360
I understand.

221
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.070
This girl is terrified.

222
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:16.480
Some people are too direct, rough, and minacious even.

223
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.820
And that's not right.

224
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.350
Ye, actually, it doesn't matter whether you sign it or not.

225
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.100
You can read the last page.

226
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.720
You just sign here as one of the key additional witnesses.

227
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.640
But you have to understand that it doesn't have to be you.

228
00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.030
It is a kind offer from the Organization.

229
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.080
My father is dead.

230
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.400
All the information is factual.

231
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.310
Otherwise, your sister wouldn't have signed it. 
 (Witnesses: Ye Wenxue)

232
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:04.100
We aim to guide those who were ideologically led astray to acknowledge their mistakes with facts.

233
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.590
I didn't know my father talked to these people.

234
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.550
Everything is real.

235
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.200
You must trust the Organization.

236
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.970
I didn't say it wasn't real.

237
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.720
I simply don't know.

238
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.480
So I can't sign it.

239
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.480
Ye Wenjie, mind your language.

240
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.790
Well, Ye, I'll be completely honest with you.

241
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:42.580
There's still a chance for you to be pardoned if you acknowledge your mistake.

242
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:48.480
It's no big deal that a young intellectual got blinded by a reactionary book.

243
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.960
We don't even need to bring it to the court.

244
00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.580
You'll go to a class, write some self-examination essays, and be sent back to the tree farm.

245
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:03.830
But if you are self-opinionated, then we'll probably take your case seriously.

246
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.240
You'll receive proper ideological education.

247
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.110
The public security system attaches importance to your case.

248
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:15.720
I came here to find out what stance you take.

249
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.780
I hope what I said to you is helpful.

250
00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.680
Representative Cheng is trying to help you.

251
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.350
As you can see here, four witnesses have signed the paper.

252
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.650
It doesn't really matter if you sign it or not. 
 (Witnesses: Ye Wenxue)

253
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.590
Ye Wenjie, you don't want to regret it for the rest of your life.

254
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.720
Ye,

255
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:42.100
it breaks my heart to see a young intellectual's future to be destroyed.

256
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.000
I really want to help you.

257
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.490
Just be cooperative.

258
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.780
Look at me.

259
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.840
Do I look like a person who would harm you?

260
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:14.410
Any soaring thoughts will eventually drop to the ground. 
 (Witnesses)

261
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:22.370
The gravity of reality is way too heavy.

262
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.500
No, I won't sign it.

263
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.650
At the time, someone like me would receive heavy sentences.

264
00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.650
What you experienced is beyond my imaginations.

265
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.680
It's in the past.

266
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.650
The past is the past.

267
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.510
The person who framed you up, do you hate him?

268
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.380
Bai Mulin?

269
00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:22.630
Under the pressure of the political environment, that was his only option.

270
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.210
But for what it's worth, that wasn't a right choice.

271
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:36.690
What is right and what is wrong?

272
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:46.150
This is the question that Silent Spring most often made me think about.

273
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:55.930
It seems so rightful for humans to use pesticides from our perspective,

274
00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.270
but how would nature view it?

275
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:05.730
What damage have humans brought upon the world?

276
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:37.340
Right or wrong is only a matter of perspectives.

277
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:46.870
The most difficult thing for us is to judge something from another perspective.

278
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:51.870
There would be no difference even you take the same perspective.

279
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.380
After that thing happened,

280
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:03.210
I left the northern tree farm and went elsewhere.

281
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:07.790
From a universal perspective, it could be right,

282
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:12.550
but it also could be wrong.

283
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:18.380
Wang, when you are at my age,

284
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:24.630
you'll realize all those things that seemed extremely important will end up being unimportant.

285
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.220
When we find ourselves pushed into desperation,

286
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.690
perhaps, the turnaround is around the corner.
