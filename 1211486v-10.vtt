<i>[ Episode 10 ]</i>

19
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.920
Lord or God, neither is related.

20
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.870
I told you that anything sufficiently weird must be fishy.

21
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.870
If you ask me, it's really like a pyramid scheme I cracked before.

22
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.150
The mental state is similar.

23
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.478
Shen Yufei must have been brainwashed.

24
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.950
I think Yang Dong's death...

25
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.680
Yes. Our only finding is concerning Yang Dong.

26
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.080
Yang Dong didn't kill herself when we thought she would.

27
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680
But she did it when she seemed unlikely to do it.

28
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.710
What happened during that period?

29
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.970
We can only make a breakthrough after we find the key point.

30
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.560
I think we should find Ding Yi again .

31
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.930
- Find Ding Yi again? 
 - Yeah.

32
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.630
We need to know in detail what Yang Dong did

33
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.281
between the experiment and her suicide. 
<i> [Large Particle Collider]</i>

34
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.480
We mustn't overlook any detail.

35
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.440
Isn't it inappropriate for me to talk with Ding Yi about Yang Dong again and again?

36
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.080
You think too much.

37
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.690
You don't even know her.

38
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.980
You just want to know her.

39
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.080
It's really inappropriate.

40
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.910
You don't have to go.

41
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.910
I have "ten people" at my disposal.

42
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.920
I asked Dr. Ding to recall some of the details.

43
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.842
I organized them in chronological order.

44
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
As for the contact of Yang Dong and her colleagues with other people, I'm still investigating.

45
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.536
Well done! You're great!

46
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.000
Generally, weddings are very important for women.

47
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.510
But Yang Dong didn't even choose her own wedding invitations. 
 <i>[ Ding Yi went out to buy invitations ]</i>

48
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.800
As a woman, she didn't even like shopping and only bought black and white outfits.

49
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.130
She used to buy several suits at one time.

50
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.630
Yes.

51
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.480
In my mind,

52
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.930
she was really simple.

53
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.300
<i>[ The couple went to a mall to shop for clothes and shoes ]</i>

54
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.930
Wait.

55
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.210
That's not right.

56
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.111
That's not right. The first time I went to Dr. Ding's house, I saw a red dress on a hanger.

57
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.190
<i>Yes.</i>

58
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.430
<i>I also saw several bright dresses when I went there,</i>

59
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.720
which were fashionable with the tags still attached.

60
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.920
It is said that they shopped for the dresses together.

61
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.760
As a woman who only paid attention to physics and never cared about her life,

62
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.320
Yang Dong dropped her research, decorated the house with Ding Yi, and prepared for their wedding.

63
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.248
Isn't it weird?

64
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.700
<i>Don't you feel like going to a concert?</i>

65
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.790
<i>Besides physicists' names, can you tell me the name of any singer?</i>

66
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.270
<i>I don't know any of them.</i>

67
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.560
<i>But we should start to know.</i>

68
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.920
<i>The album you often play while driving isn't bad.</i>

69
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.954
<i>I've played it for years.</i>

70
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.360
<i>I think your research...</i>

71
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.824
<i>Shall we ask a fortune teller to designate an auspicious for our wedding?</i>

72
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.558
<i>Do you like it? I had a manicure recently.</i>

73
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.180
<i>It's good.</i>

74
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.480
<i>The bed is comfy.</i>

75
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.572
<i>Let's order this one.</i>

76
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.190
<i>As Shen Yufei said, Yang Dong started to enjoy life.</i>

77
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.950
<i>At least since then, after Yang Dong contacted Shen Yufei, she had shown signs of change.</i>

78
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.290
<i>It's just normal for ordinary women to do those things.</i>

79
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.020
- But Yang Dong was different.
- So what do you mean?

80
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.720
It isn't normal for a female physicist to do such things, is it?

81
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.070
<i>That day, she went to a furniture mall with Ding Yi.</i>

82
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.900
<i>She stayed there all day long</i>

83
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.510
<i>without mentioning anything about physics.</i>

84
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.120
<i>I like this one.</i>

85
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.850
<i>It's special.</i>

86
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.490
<i>According to Ding Yi, it was rare for Yang Dong to not discuss physics with him.</i>

87
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.900
<i>And from that day on, she seldom exchanged academic information with him.</i>

88
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.930
<i>Shall we get a tub?</i>

89
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.720
<i>Then we can take a flower bath every night.</i>

90
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.800
That might be another sign of despair.

91
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.120
Yeah.

92
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.830
But she seemed very happy.

93
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.600
Look, this is her photo at that time.

94
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.170
She seemed relaxed and in a completely different state of mind from when you took the photo of her.

95
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.210
<i>It feels good.</i>

96
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.646
<i>If you like, we can come here often.</i>

97
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.020
<i>I didn't expect that we could enjoy such leisure time.</i>

98
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.912
<i>We can live like this in the future.</i>

99
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.730
Shi Qiang, I really don't know what you want to do.

100
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.320
You asked me to stop my work, come here,

101
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.130
and review all the things about Ding Yi and Yang Dong with you.

102
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.030
Isn't it absurd?

103
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.360
You guys do one thing over and over again in scientific research.

104
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.270
- Isn't it absurd?
- We were doing experiments.

105
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.700
We have to seek proof repeatedly.

106
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:19.840
When we detectives review the path that victims and suspects have taken,

107
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.200
we're also seeking proof.

108
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.320
Why do you get heated?

109
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.320
Why do you get heated every time I mention Yang Dong?

110
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.160
Enough, I can't win an argument against you.

111
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.130
Why don't you get heated on hearing Shen Yufei's name?

112
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.160
- Did you really meet Yang Dong just once? 
 - All right.

113
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.840
We've reviewed everything again.

114
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.480
Have you drawn any conclusions?

115
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:41.300
The conclusion is that after Shen Yufei contacted Yang Dong,

116
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.320
Yang seemed to have given up scientific research.

117
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.090
She wanted to be a housewife.

118
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.820
She chose to be a carefree turkey.

119
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.390
If she was carefree, why did she commit suicide?

120
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.840
Only Lord knows.

121
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.824
Shen Yufei's "Lord"?

122
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.240
<i>Obviously Pan Han and his people are against us,</i>

123
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.600
<i>especially for our attitude towards Wang Miao.</i>

124
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:23.044
<i>Commander, does it make any sense to win over Wang Miao in this way?</i>

125
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.676
<i>[Does redemption or destruction make sense ?]</i>

126
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.600
<i>Yes.</i>

127
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.750
<i>They did many things in a more extreme way than us.</i>

128
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:50.720
<i>They targeted at scientists directly and even destroyed many scientific research bases.</i>

129
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.716
<i>But I have to say, their actions have a greater impact than ours.</i>

130
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:11.816
<i>[People can see destruction, but most of them can't see redemption.]</i>

131
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.270
Welcome to discuss the significance

132
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:36.334
of the existence of science at this meeting with us.

133
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.480
It's important to find out someone's behavior.

134
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.770
Look, by reviewing Yang Dong's behavior,

135
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.870
we can find that after the failure of the Liangxiang experiment

136
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:05.350
and the suicide of Professor Munphy, she found that physics might not exist.

137
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.200
Then she contacted Shen Yufei.

138
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.750
She was sure that physics didn't exist.

139
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.490
Yang Dong's words were, "Physics has never existed."

140
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.480
Is there any difference?

141
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.270
Of course there is.

142
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.600
If physics doesn't exist, there may be a problem with our fundamental theory.

143
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.920
If physics has never existed,

144
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.600
it would overthrow human's understanding of the entire earth for thousands of years,

145
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.590
whether in the macro world or in the micro world.

146
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.550
How could they be the same?

147
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.840
Fine, I agree with you, okay?

148
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.480
I agree with you.

149
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.550
Then, well... She, well, well, then she would...

150
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.220
She would choose to be a carefree turkey, right?

151
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.770
Then she prepared to live a normal life.

152
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.050
She accepted Ding Yi's proposal,

153
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.750
bought a house and began to decorate it 
 <i>[Decorate the new house. Apply for a job]</i>

154
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.720
till she found a new job.

155
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.790
Is that right, Xu Bingbing?

156
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.340
I inquired about it at the Institute of Applied Physics.

157
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.720
The head there said that they really hoped an expert in fundamental physics

158
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.870
like Yang Dong would work there.

159
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:10.240
Yang Dong herself was also very enthusiastic about her new job.

160
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:17.190
But unfortunately, on the third day after she accepted the offer, she killed herself.

161
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.600
The people of the Institute were deeply distressed too.

162
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.010
They didn't know the reason.

163
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.750
That's right.

164
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.360
That's the problem.

165
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.270
The last three days are the point.

166
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.060
What did she do?

167
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.730
Suicide note.

168
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.490
She should have written the note during that time.

169
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.180
That's right.

170
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.610
If in the last three days,

171
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:43.990
she found out that physics had never existed,

172
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.610
how did she find it without contacting Shen Yufei?

173
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.460
Had she straightened out her thinking, then in the last two days,

174
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.360
she was confused again?

175
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.884
Xu Bingbing.

176
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.540
There was a countdown in front of my eyes too.

177
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.960
<i>I've also seen the universe flicker.</i>

178
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.290
<i>- I was really desperate at that time.
- Tell me what will happen (flashback)</i>

179
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.120
<i> at the end of the countdown!</i>

180
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.770
<i>I might have thought of suicide, but more likely,</i>

181
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.820
<i>I was going to live negatively, give up my research,</i>

182
00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.370
be a teacher, and muddle along the rest of my life.

183
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:30.310
But suddenly one day, there was another countdown in front of my eyes, or something else that shocked me.

184
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:36.610
I can't imagine how great the shock was to make me give up my life.

185
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.270
Does that make sense?

186
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.720
It makes sense.

187
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.840
It all makes sense.

188
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.480
Let me tell you the rest.

189
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.624
During that period, Yang Dong was about to start a normal life blithely.

190
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.900
But the weird thing is,

191
00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.490
Yang Dong's mother,

192
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.340
Professor Ye Wenjie,

193
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.440
seems to have never mentioned any changes of Yang Dong in this period.

194
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.630
It doesn't seem right.

195
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.550
As a mom, why doesn't she care about her daughter at all?

196
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.600
Are you suggesting that Professor Ye

197
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.540
has never cared about her daughter, right? 
 <i>[Ye Wenjie Professor of Tsinghua University]</i>

198
00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.440
That's not right.

199
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.320
Unlike you, Professor Ye doesn't spend all her days on research.

200
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.270
She is a retired old lady.

201
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.150
<i>If she has time to take care of her neighbors' children,</i>

202
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.920
<i>how could she not notice such a big change that happened to her own daughter?</i>

203
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:39.180
So, I think you should find some time to have a good talk with Professor Ye.

204
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.060
Don't you like talking with her?

205
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.288
You'll get more information talking to her than if I question her directly.

206
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.300
Helping you mess with these things seriously occupies lots of my research time.

207
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:02.440
Professor Wang, if physics has never existed, what's the point in your stupid research?

208
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.740
I, uh, I just, I... I, I... I just...

209
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.870
What did I just say that offended him?

210
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.308
You scientists are all childish, aren't you?

211
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.031
Oh, right.

212
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:21.440
You're a cop.

213
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.992
D-don't take his side.

214
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.580
I consulted experts about the universe flickering.

215
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.550
What did you get?

216
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.910
Tell me about the results of your investigation first.

217
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.540
The investigation has reached an impasse.

218
00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.000
Wang Miao and Sha Ruishan both mentioned that

219
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:55.000
they might have put a large screen in space very far from the earth.

220
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.320
A very large screen, like playing a movie.

221
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.520
I haven't found out more than you have.

222
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.450
You know what, your metaphor is very vivid.

223
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.000
Put a large screen in the air, just like playing a movie.

224
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.510
I can hardly contradict that.

225
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.020
The only thing I can contradict is humans can't do that.

226
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.070
Definitely.

227
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.570
Fishy.

228
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:27.046
Just because humans can't do it, does that mean it can't happen?

229
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.810
Chang, what do you mean?

230
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.588
Is Shen Yufei an alien?

231
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.350
<i>Did you hear... Did you hear what I told you?</i>

232
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.150
<i>Alien!</i>

233
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.680
<i>Did you hear what I told you? Alien!</i>

234
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.550
<i>That's a possibility.</i>

235
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.960
Do you mean you believe it?

236
00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.820
Like the fishy things you often say, alien is just a byword.

237
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:08.430
<i>When we face supernatural phenomena and things that science can't explain, we attribute it to aliens.</i>

238
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.930
<i>But what are aliens?</i>

239
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.240
<i>We have no idea.</i>

240
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.350
But now, everything is really happening before us.

241
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.240
I don't care if it's an alien's trick or a fishy thing.

242
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.020
I want to explore what it really is, what form it exists in,

243
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.000
what kind of power it has and what its purpose is.

244
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.612
I think it's the greatest value for us if I puzzle all these problems out, right?

245
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.100
<i>I was right about you. You're definitely not an average turkey.</i>

246
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:54.030
<i>Then what's the difference between aliens' tricks and fishy things?</i>

247
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.950
I also have the right to think.

248
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.580
<i>[Tsinghua University]</i>

249
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.020
<i>This is nanomaterial.</i>

250
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.000
<i>Let's call it a day today.</i>

251
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.150
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>

252
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.191
Let's go.

253
00:19:10.191 --> 00:19:12.170
Let's go now.

254
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.511
Hurry up.

255
00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:22.200
- Professor, goodbye.
- Bye.

256
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.800
- Professor, goodbye.
- Bye.

257
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.381
- Xiao Wang. 
- Ms. Ye.

258
00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:32.750
Thank you.

259
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.650
I know you managed to take time out of your busy research

260
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.130
in order to give my students a lecture on applied physics.

261
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.320
I'm so happy to meet with your approval.

262
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.850
Though I'm retired, I'm still interested in academics.

263
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:57.750
Sometimes, when they hold such an event, I'll come to attend.

264
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:03.340
The research in our life needs successors.

265
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.680
By the way, Professor Ye,

266
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.920
some things have happened recently in the Frontiers of Science.

267
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.310
The investigation team asked me to assist in their work.

268
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:20.240
Recently, I read some files about your past experiences.

269
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.150
A part of them seem to not have been declassified yet.

270
00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.680
Yes.

271
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.980
It was really a special experience.

272
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.460
In fact, there are no secrets anymore.

273
00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.640
You've never lived in that era.

274
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.840
â™« <i>Advance! Advance!</i> â™«

275
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:54.330
That was a memorable era. 
 â™« <i>The momentum of revolution is unstoppable<i> â™«</i></i>
â™« <i>Advance! Advance!</i> â™«

276
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.290
â™« <i>In the direction of victory</i> â™«

277
00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.050
â™« <i>Three red flags are fluttering in the wind</i> â™«

278
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.110
<i>Take a step!</i>

279
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.720
<i>Left foot!</i>

280
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.640
<i>Take a step!</i>

281
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.590
<i>Left foot!</i>

282
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.880
<i>Right foot!</i>

283
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.410
<i>Self-reliance!</i>

284
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.890
<i>Come on!</i>

285
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.140
<i>Self-reliance!</i>

286
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.600
<i>Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

287
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.700
<i>Chop the branches down.</i>

288
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:55.000
<i>Back then, the administration sent educated youths to the countryside.</i>

289
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.400
<i>I was assigned to the Greater Khingan Mountains.</i>

290
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.400
<i>Come on!</i>

291
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.000
<i>We plant trees in all directions.</i>

292
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200
<i>We can shoulder an entire mountain.</i>

293
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.800
<i>Hurry up.</i>

294
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.600
<i>Comrade, move!</i>

295
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.000
<i>Go ahead.</i>

296
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.300
<i>Next one.</i>

297
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.800
<i>Ma Gang, come here.</i>

298
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.200
<i>Can I help you, Mr. Bai?</i>

299
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.800
<i>Let me ask you a question.</i>

300
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.200
<i>Do you know how old this tree was?</i>

301
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.000
<i>You can count the rings.</i>

302
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.400
<i>I did.</i>

303
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.400
<i>Most of the trees here are over 300 years.</i>

304
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.400
<i>How long it took you to saw through it?</i>

305
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.600
<i>No more than ten minutes.</i>

306
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.400
<i>Let me tell you, I'm the fastest chain saw operator in the company.</i>

307
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.400
<i>Whichever squad I'm with, the red flag for model workers follows me.</i>

308
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.800
<i>More than three hundred years.</i>

309
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.100
<i>A dozen generations.</i>

310
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.000
<i>When this tree was but a shrub, it was still the Ming Dynasty.</i>

311
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.800
<i>During all these years, how many storms it had weathered?</i>

312
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.300
<i>How many events it had witnessed?</i>

313
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800
<i>But in a few minutes, you cut it down.</i>

314
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.200
<i>You really felt nothing?</i>

315
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.300
<i>What do you want me to feel?</i>

316
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300
<i>It's just a tree.</i>

317
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.500
<i>The only things we don't lack around here are trees.</i>

318
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.800
<i>There are plenty of trees much older than this one.</i>

319
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.300
<i>All right. Go back to work.</i>

320
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:25.100
<i>Mr. Bai, can I be featured in the Great Production News?</i>

321
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:36.400
Intellectuals always
make a fuss about nothing.

322
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.200
<i>Hello.</i>

323
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.200
<i>Are you Ye Wenjie?</i>

324
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.900
<i>I'm a reporter for the Great Production News, Bai Mulin.</i>

325
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.500
<i>I saw you when you borrowed books from the production team.</i>

326
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.400
<i>I know you.</i>

327
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.600
<i>I've read your articles.</i>

328
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.000
<i>I can tell how you're feeling.</i>

329
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.600
<i>The two of us are the only ones who feel this way.</i>

330
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.000
<i>Come and take a rest.</i>

331
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.200
<i>I visited this region a year ago.</i>

332
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.000
<i>I remember arriving around noon,</i>

333
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.600
<i>and my hosts told me that we'd have fish for lunch.</i>

334
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.400
<i>I looked around the bark-lined hut</i>

335
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.500
<i>and saw only a pot of water being boiled.</i>

336
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.300
<i>No fish.</i>

337
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.800
<i>Then, as soon as the water boiled,</i>

338
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.900
<i>the cook went out with a rolling pin.</i>

339
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.800
<i>He stood by the brook that passed before the hut,</i>

340
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.200
<i>struck the water with the rolling pin,</i>

341
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.900
<i>and dragged big fish out of the water.</i>

342
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.400
<i>What a fertile place!</i>

343
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.800
<i>But look at that brook now.</i>

344
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.700
<i>It's just dead, muddy water in a ditch.</i>

345
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.500
<i>I really don't know</i>

346
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:29.700
<i>if they're engaged in construction or destruction.</i>

347
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.000
<i>Where did you get these thoughts?</i>

348
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
<i>I just read a book, and it really moved me.</i>

349
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300
<i>Can you read English?</i>

350
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.600
<i>This was published in 1962 and was very influential in the West.</i>

351
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.300
<i>Silent Spring, Rachel Carson.</i>

352
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.200
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

353
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.000
<i>The book attracted the attention of the higher-ups.</i>

354
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.900
<i>They want to use it for internal reference.</i>

355
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.600
<i>I'm responsible for translating the part about forests.</i>

356
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.200
<i>What does the book talk about?</i>

357
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.400
<i>Pesticides and the environment?</i>

358
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.000
<i>There's something deeper.</i>

359
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.600
<i>I want to write to the central leadership</i>

360
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.400
<i>and inform them the bad phenomena.</i>

361
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.200
<i>Keep it if you want to read it.</i>

362
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.700
<i>But don't let anyone see it.</i>

363
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.000
<i>This kind of book, you know...</i>

364
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.400
<i>OK.</i>

365
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:15.200
â™«<i> Flying wild geese  </i>â™«

366
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:26.400
â™«<i>  Please fly quickly   </i>â™«

367
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:37.000
â™«<i>  Send a message to my hometown   </i>â™«

368
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.400
â™«<i>  The children from afar miss   </i>â™«

369
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.800
â™«<i>  Their homesick mother   </i>â™«

370
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:56.600
â™«<i>  Flying wild geese   </i>â™«

371
00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:08.000
â™«<i>  Please fly quickly   </i>â™«

372
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:18.400
â™«<i>  Send a message to my hometown   </i>â™«

373
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:25.000
â™«<i>  The children from afar miss   </i>â™«

374
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.300
<i>The book dealt only with a limited subject,</i>

375
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:37.000
<i>the negative environmental effects of excessive pesticide use.</i>

376
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:49.600
<i>But the description in the book shook me to the core.</i>

377
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.220
<i>Chairman Mao wrote in On Practice,</i>

378
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.040
<i>Marxists regard</i>

379
00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.090
<i>man's activity in production as the most fundamental practical activity,</i>

380
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.050
<i>the determinant of all his other activities.</i>

381
00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.260
<i>Man's knowledge</i>

382
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.360
<i>depends mainly on his activity in material production,</i>

383
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.780
<i>through which he comes gradually to understand the phenomena,</i>

384
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.020
<i>the properties and the laws of nature...</i>

385
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.940
<i>â™ª We are marching on a great road â™ª</i>

386
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.060
<i>Ready? Begin!</i>

387
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:43.140
<i>â™ª We are marching on a great road â™ª</i>

388
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.980
<i>â™ª Spirits high and fighting will strong â™ª</i>

389
00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.020
<i>Keep up. Don't lag behind.</i>

390
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.180
<i>Pack up the firewood piled in the west and move it into the warehouse.</i>

391
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.800
<i>Yes!</i>

392
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
<i>Take a break in your huts.</i>

393
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.800
<i>Gather in five minutes for the meeting.</i>

394
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.900
<i>Wenjie.</i>

395
00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.200
<i>- Did you work today? 
- Next.</i>

396
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.400
<i>I've been with the company for so long.</i>

397
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.300
<i>I can't just walk around doing nothing.</i>

398
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.400
<i>Have to participate in labor.</i>

399
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.700
<i>That's the spirit of the revolution.</i>

400
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.400
<i>Your name?</i>

401
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.600
<i>Bai Mulin.</i>

402
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.200
<i>A chain saw.</i>

403
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.600
<i>A rod.</i>

404
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.400
<i>- OK. Go ahead.
- Thanks.</i>

405
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.400
<i>I worked near Radar Peak.</i>

406
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.600
<i>The trees there were so dense.</i>

407
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.600
<i>I sank into the rotting leaves up to my knees.</i>

408
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.200
<i>I fear I'll get sick from the miasma.</i>

409
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.500
<i>Radar Peak?</i>

410
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.700
<i>Yes.</i>

411
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.600
<i>The regiment urgently assigns us</i>

412
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.400
<i>to clear out a warning zone around it by cutting down trees.</i>

413
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.700
<i>What's this place?</i>

414
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.400
<i>It's said to be a military base.</i>

415
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.000
<i>According to the folks, when it was built three years ago,</i>

416
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.400
<i>the military mobilized a lot of people to string a power line</i>

417
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.600
<i>along the peak and to construct a road leading to the top.</i>

418
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.000
<i>Tons of supplies were transported up the mountain.</i>

419
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.200
<i>It seems to be an important place.</i>

420
00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:31.000
<i>But after the completion of the base, the road was destroyed.</i>

421
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.400
<i>What's the sound?</i>

422
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.500
<i>Look.</i>

423
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.000
<i>The antenna appears.</i>

424
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.400
<i>What is that?</i>

425
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.600
<i>The peak was nameless before.</i>

426
00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:01.270
<i>It got its moniker from the large parabolic antenna dish at the top.</i>

427
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.800
<i>What is it used for?</i>

428
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.000
<i>It doesn't look like a radar antenna.</i>

429
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.500
<i>I don't know.</i>

430
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.900
<i>Though its orientation always changes,</i>

431
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.000
<i>it's never moved in a continuous manner.</i>

432
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.000
<i>Let's go.</i>

433
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:35.200
<i>I've been here for so long, but I never noticed it.</i>

434
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.300
<i>The antenna isn't always visible.</i>

435
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.500
<i>But when it's extended, many strange things will occur.</i>

436
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.800
<i>Animals in the forest become noisy and anxious.</i>

437
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:52.000
<i>Birds erupt from the woods, and people will suffer nausea and dizziness.</i>

438
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.800
<i>Also, those who live near Radar Peak tend to lose their hair.</i>

439
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:01.200
<i>According to the folks, these only began after the antenna was built.</i>

440
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.800
<i>Radioactive rays?</i>

441
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.400
<i>It's more than that.</i>

442
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:12.500
<i>One time, when it was snowing, the antenna was extended, and the snow instantly turned to rain.</i>

443
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:19.800
<i>Sometimes, when the antenna was extended, a clear day would turn to thunder and lightning,</i>

444
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.500
<i>and strange lights would appear in the night sky.</i>

445
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.400
<i>It's a forbidden area.</i>

446
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.200
<i>Before I came here, I was told to avoid approaching the place,</i>

447
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.600
<i>or the patrols were allowed to shoot without warning.</i>

448
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.400
<i>Do you remember the two men who were reprimanded last week?</i>

449
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.400
<i>No sooner than they chased a deer to the foot</i>

450
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.600
<i>of Radar Peak, the sentries stationed halfway up the peak shot at them.</i>

451
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.900
<i>They were so terrified and turned to run.</i>

452
00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.900
<i>[Military Zone]</i>

453
00:35:54.900 --> 00:36:01.400
<i>Luckily, the forest was so dense that they weren't hurt, though one of them peed in his pants.</i>

454
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:08.000
<i>When they returned to the company the next day, both were reprimanded.</i>

455
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
<i>Maybe it was because of this incident, we were directed to create a warning zone.</i>

456
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.600
<i>Could the base issue labor assignments to us?</i>

457
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:23.500
<i>I hear it has great political power.</i>

458
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600
<i>I have to go now.</i>

459
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.100
<i>OK.</i>

460
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:38.978
<i>[The whole nation should study earnestly the international situation.]</i>

<i>Come in.</i>

467
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.000
<i>Wenjie.</i>

468
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.600
<i>I'm here to return your book.</i>

469
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.800
<i>I was going to look for you.</i>

470
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.600
<i>You're just in time.</i>

471
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.100
<i>I'll show you the letter I wrote.</i>

472
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.600
<i>Letter?</i>

473
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.500
<i>Yes.</i>

474
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:58.100
<i>I told you last time that I was going to write to the central leadership.</i>

475
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
<i>Take a seat.</i>

476
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.400
<i>Sorry.</i>

477
00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.800
<i>My handwriting is sloppy.</i>

478
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.200
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

479
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600
<i>The Taihang Mountains have turned from</i>

480
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.010
<i>a historically fertile place to the barren wasteland due to deforestation.</i>

481
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.700
<i>The Yellow River's silt is rising rapidly now.</i>

482
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.600
<i>The great reclamation in the northern tree farm will lead to severe consequences.</i>

483
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.600
<i>The content is informative and tightly argued.</i>

484
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
<i>Okay.</i>

485
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.400
<i>I'll make a clean copy of the draft.</i>

486
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.100
<i>Don't burn yourself.</i>

487
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:28.200
<i>My hands are trembling due to frequent use of the chain saw.</i>

488
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.400
<i>[Respected]</i>

489
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.100
<i>Perfect.</i>

490
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800
<i>This sheet is wasted.</i>

491
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.000
<i>Why don't I copy it for you?</i>

492
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.800
<i>The chain saw is too heavy.</i>

493
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.700
<i>No wonder your hand is trembling.</i>

494
00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.000
<i>Let me copy it for you.</i>

495
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.000
<i>Okay.</i>

496
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.800
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>

497
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.400
<i>[Respected]</i>

498
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.600
<i>You have pretty handwriting.</i>

499
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.600
<i>You studied physics?</i>

500
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.500
<i>Astrophysics.</i>

501
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.600
<i>Useless now.</i>

502
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.100
<i>Astrophysics?</i>

503
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.500
<i>So you study the stars?</i>

504
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.800
<i>How can that be useless?</i>

505
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.800
<i>Colleges have reopened recently, but they're not taking graduate students.</i>

506
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.600
<i>A highly educated talent like you has been sent to this place...</i>

507
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.000
<i>It's a shame.</i>

508
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:59.500
<i>I didn't tell him that I was fortunate enough to be sent to the northern tree farm.</i>

509
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:03.800
<i>[50,000 educated youths all over the country...]</i>

510
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.200
<i>At the moment, the hut was quiet.</i>

511
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.000
<i>I could hear the sound of pen nib scratching against paper,</i>

512
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:24.000
<i>and smell the fragrance of the sawdust.</i>

513
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.400
Since my father died,

514
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.900
I hadn't felt relaxed &gt;and experienced warmth for a long time.
