00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.960
(Ye Wenjie
(Professor of Tsinghua University))

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.200
What does this mean?

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.400
Ye Wenjie was hurt, but she didn't hate the man who hurt her.

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.400
What else did she mention?

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.400
She thought she was screwed, but then she went to a place.

7
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.390
What place?

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
Don't ask me. Find it out yourself.

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
Why are you looking at me?
Go find it out.

10
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.000
OK. OK.

11
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.000
OK. OK.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.400
Seeing that everyone is busy without gaining anything, how do you feel?

13
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.200
If you're too depressed,
you can play that game too.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.000
The combat zones have recently found that many high-level intellectuals

15
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
are also playing the Three-Body game.

16
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200
Isn't it a significant finding?

17
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.400
It seems that our team is valuable.

18
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
So have you got more valuable information?

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Sure.

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
I'm waiting for the files.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
Ye Wenjie's files?

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.400
Why do you have to dig into her?

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.100
I wasn't interested in the old lady at all
in the beginning.

24
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.900
But now, I have to be interested in her.

25
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.000
Yang Dong committed suicide,
and she's Yang Dong's mother.

26
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.400
In the Frontiers of Science,
she has contact with Shen Yufei.

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.200
When I dig into the game
and the universe flicker...

28
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.000
What's that?

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.700
That's astrophysics.

30
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.400
I find that she's an astrophysicist.

31
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.600
As an astrophysicist, she unexpectedly believes that physics doesn't exist.

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.000
Physics does exist,

33
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.000
only that the physics we believe
doesn't exist.

34
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.400
Many seemingly unrelated clues
meet at one point.

35
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.000
So, Chang, I must dig into the point.

36
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.400
A part of her files isn't declassified.

37
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000
That's exactly what I asked you
to deal with.

38
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
Be patient.

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.600
Everything has to
go through a process.

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.800
It's been dozens of years.

41
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.700
What's there in that era
worth keeping secret?

42
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.200
Use your connections to get the files.

43
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.100
We found that many years ago, she participated in a major national defense project

44
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.800
of which the applicant
was Red Coast Base.

45
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.400
Base?

46
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
For military purpose?

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.100
Not necessarily.

48
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.690
And at that base, there was
an unprecedented huge antenna.

49
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.500
I guess it was used for information interference against the West.

50
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.200
Information warfare?

51
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.400
Chang, find a way to get the files.

52
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.300
It's urgent.

53
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.600
Don't urge me.

54
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.200
Who else can I urge?

55
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.400
You have many people around here.
How many do I have?

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.000
Don't you know I only have
11 staff quota?

57
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Don't you know?

66
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.800
(Now, preparations for the Olympic Games
are in full swing.)

67
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.000
(The Official website of
the Beijing Olympic Games...)

68
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.600
- Go.
 - I'll eat more and reach this line.

69
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.400
180 cm? Then you'll be as tall as Dad.

70
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.100
Mom will be worried
if you grow to 180 cm.

71
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.200
OK, come down.
Wash your hands and have dinner.

72
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.500
- Come. Wash your hands.
- Time for dinner.

73
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.200
I want ice cream.

74
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800
No.

75
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.400
Hello?

76
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.600
I was measuring Doudou's height.

77
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.200
She's grown 2 cm in three months.

78
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.200
So what?

79
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.400
My mother said that I had grown 5 cm in less than two months after I was born.

80
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400
Isn't that normal?

81
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.380
What I mean is you can only realize the change in height by comparison, so is the Three-Body game.

82
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.200
When I first logged in,

83
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.800
King Wen of Zhou tried to deduce by divination when the Stable Era would possibly arrive.

84
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.200
During each civilization after that, many people were studying the laws governing the sun's motion.

85
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.600
We may advance the game
if we find the law.

86
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.000
Then you must find the law.

87
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.800
You can do it.

88
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.600
Don't worry. I'll be there for you.

89
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.700
It requires a lot of
professional knowledge to play the game.

90
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.400
It's the best if a scientist working
in this field would play with me.

91
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.300
Bro, you're asking for a scientist
who has time to play games.

92
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.000
Where can I find him?

93
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Do you think everyone can see
the countdown like you do?

94
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Is the food ready?

95
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.500
Right away.

96
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
There is really a chosen one.

97
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.800
- Who is it? 
 - Please enjoy.

98
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.200
Forget about the food. Let's go.

99
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.600
I'm used to it.

100
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:18.000
These days,
I've been living in the flicker.

101
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Are you the chosen one?

102
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.600
Yes.

103
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.200
I'm the chosen one.

104
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.000
What's this?

105
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.900
The model I made based on
the principle of the universe flicker.

106
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.700
Next, we'll expand it into a light belt with a length of 300,000 km, and then launch it into the universe.

107
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.300
In this way, we can reproduce the universe flicker on that day.

108
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.100
Who are you?

109
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.300
Did I give you permission?

110
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200
I'm Shi Qiang.

111
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.000
Who is Shi Qiang?

112
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.700
A cop.

113
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.400
Well, the cops came that day.

114
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.500
I told them everything.

115
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.600
I didn't do it, though I really want to.

116
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.600
Dr. Sha, let me explain.

117
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.500
The reason why we're here today

118
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.600
is to offer a new breakthrough point
for you to know the entire thing.

119
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.000
What point?

120
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.500
It's a game.

121
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.000
I know well about games.

122
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.400
Look.

123
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.200
Professional player.

124
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.600
Have you played the game?

125
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.800
I've played it for a couple of days,
getting nowhere.

126
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.700
Don't worry.

127
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.600
With my help, you'll pass it soon.

128
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.400
The game is a little special.

129
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.200
You have to wear a V-suit to play it.

130
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.400
Yeah.

131
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.700
We'll give you the V-suit.

132
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.400
Then give me 40 sets first.

133
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.100
Pardon?

134
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.000
40 sets.

135
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.300
Are you insane?

136
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.300
I have to take enough partners
when I load down instance zones.

137
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.900
Do you know how much a set costs?

138
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.800
Do you know how complicated
the approval process is?

139
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800
Do you think the Finance
will approve 40 sets?

140
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.800
How did you blurt it out?

141
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.000
What about eight sets?

142
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.300
Five sets at most.

143
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.100
That will do.

144
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.400
I'll farm an average instance first
and raid progression.

145
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.300
(The harm of Science and Technology
to the Environment)

146
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.500
With these clues,
I'll find out everything else.

147
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.400
But there are several questions I have to ask. 
  (Explosion Vibration Caused Collapse of Nearby Buildings)

148
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.430
I suggest you not to ask unnecessary questions.

149
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.800
How did you get such information?

150
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.100
I told you before that when numerous people like you and me were united,

151
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.600
they couldn't cover up many things.

152
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.600
What exactly do you want to do?

153
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.200
Tell more people about the truth.

154
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.700
Before I read the files, I didn't even know that technology could do such great harm to the environment.

155
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.300
Are you not worried that the public would resist technology after seeing the report?

156
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.000
What people resist is the harm that comes with technology instead of technology itself.

157
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.800
We just presented the truth.

158
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.100
We didn't force anyone
to choose or judge.

159
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.900
You?

160
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.000
Who are you?

161
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.100
You don't have to ask that
when you replace "you" with "we".

162
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.500
Hello.

163
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.000
Wang Miao, I have an emergency case.

164
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.400
You'll have to pick up Doudou.

165
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.200
OK, got it.

166
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
No, I can't play it now.

167
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.300
Li Yao has an emergency case.

168
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.000
I'll have to pick up my daughter.

169
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Don't leave.

170
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.600
The game is important.

171
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.500
I'll pick her up.

172
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.000
But I have to take her to dinner.

173
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.200
I'll take her to dinner.

174
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.600
OK.

175
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.600
Drive my car.

176
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.700
OK.

177
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.400
Don't smoke in front of my daughter.

178
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.600
Ah? What did you say?

179
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200
I asked you...

180
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.600
I asked you not to
smoke in front of my daughter.

181
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.100
Got it.

182
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.300
(Hairen, Welcome back to Three-Body.)

183
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400
(The soil color changes again.)

184
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.800
(It's the change in composition
under new climatic conditions.)

185
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.400
(How many years have passed?)

186
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.700
(The pyramid and the dehydratories
have changed greatly, too.)

187
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.200
Hairen.

188
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.300
You know me?

189
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.000
I'm Qin Guli.

190
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.000
Last time I came here,
the pyramid was Egyptian in style.

191
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.500
Now it resembles an Aztec one.

192
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.000
That's because this is
a completely different civilization.

193
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.100
Are you going to the apex?

194
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.700
- Yes, I am.
- I want to have a look.

195
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.100
There are too many conjectures
about the secrets of the world.

196
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.200
The instruments at the apex
may be helpful to you.

197
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.600
(There are so many telescopes.)

198
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.900
(It looks like an observatory.)

199
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.940
Hello.

200
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.200
I'm Mozi.

201
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.700
Hello, I'm Hairen.

202
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.600
I know you.

203
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.900
You were a follower of King Wen, right?

204
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.500
I did follow him here,
but I wasn't his follower.

205
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.500
Because I never believed his theories.

206
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.200
You were right.

207
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.200
Have you found the laws
governing the sun's motion?

208
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.600
Let me show you the efforts
of the last civilization.

209
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:16.700
From Civilization No. 137 of King Wen to now, civilization has been reborn four more times.

210
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.800
The shortest-lived one got only
halfway through the Stone Age,

211
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:28.000
but Civilization No. 139 broke a record and developed all the way to the Steam Age.

212
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.300
What's that?

213
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.100
That's Confucius.

214
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.300
Confucius?

215
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.700
As expected, in the game, time and space and names are all disordered.

216
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.100
They're just some symbols.

217
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.200
He believed that everything had to fit order and propriety, and nothing in the universe could be exempt.

218
00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.800
He created a system of rites
for the universe.

219
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800
I can imagine the result.

220
00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.800
Right you are.

221
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.100
He calculated when the sun would follow the rites, and predicted a five-year Stable Era.

222
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.600
You know what?

223
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.400
There was indeed a Stable Era
lasting a month.

224
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400
And then one day,
the sun just didn't come out?

225
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.600
No, the sun rose that day as well.

226
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.600
It rose to the middle of the sky,
and then went out.

227
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.700
What? Went out?

228
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.300
Yes.

229
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:33.100
It gradually dimmed, became smaller, and then went out all of a sudden.

230
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.600
Night fell.

231
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.200
Oh, the cold.

232
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.200
Confucius stood there and
froze into a column of ice.

233
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.300
And there he remains.

234
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.600
Was there nothing remaining
after the sun went out?

235
00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.400
A flying star appeared in that location, like a soul left behind after the sun died.

236
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.700
-Are you sure that the sun really disappeared suddenly, and the flying star appeared just as suddenly? 
 -Yes.

237
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.600
That did happen all of a sudden.

238
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.400
You can check the historical annals.

239
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.400
It was clearly recorded.

240
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.700
How can it be?

241
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.700
Just went out suddenly?

242
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.200
What level has the civilization
developed to?

243
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.100
It should be the Han Dynasty.

244
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.300
Forget about the Western Han
or the Eastern Han.

245
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.200
I have a mission, observing
the precise movements of the sun.

246
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:39.200
Unlike those shamans,
Legalists or Daoists,

247
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:45.400
who have no ability to do experiments and are immersed in their mysticism,

248
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.800
I know how to make practical things.

249
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.000
Remember to tell Doudou to keep
a good habit of correcting errors.

250
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.600
OK. Goodbye.

251
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.400
Bye-bye.

252
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.200
Goodbye.

253
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.600
Thank you.

254
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.200
I'm one of your dad's friends.

255
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.800
You can call me Uncle Shi.

256
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.000
None of Dad's friends smokes.

257
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.600
Where are my parents?

258
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.100
Your mom is working overtime. Your dad is busy. Come with me.

259
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.600
I'll treat you to delicious food.

260
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:30.500
I'll treat you to the food
that your parents wouldn't let you eat, OK?

261
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.400
(Pollution scandals of pharmaceutical
factories emerge continuously.)

262
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.200
(It's reported that these are chemical wastes discharged from nearby pharmaceutical factories.)

263
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.000
(The toxic substances in the wastes will contaminate the soil and crops.)

264
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.200
(After villagers' livestock eat the wastes, the toxin will remain permanently in their body.)

265
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.200
(And the pollutants will eventually
get in human's body through food.)

266
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.700
(According to the hospitals' data, in the villages nearby, 27 congenitally deformed babies have been born.)

267
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:19.000
(Why has medical technology, which is supposed to improve people's health, become a devil?)

268
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.200
(Is the development of technology a sweet fruit or a tumor to human?)

269
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:30.200
(If there are such news cues around you, please call us on the number at the bottom of the screen.)

270
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.000
Hello.

271
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.800
Do you have any news cues
to share with us?

272
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.200
Hello, I want to speak to Mu Xing.

273
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.000
Hello.

274
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.400
Do you have any information about
environmental pollution to share with us?

275
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.200
I want to talk to Mu Xing, the reporter.

276
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.600
Hello.

277
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.000
Do you have any problems?

278
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.600
There are problems with you.

279
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.300
Be polite. I want to talk to you.

280
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.700
I...

281
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700
Hello.

282
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.900
The reporter, Mu Xing,
find out where she is.

283
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Would you like
stewed assorted giblets later?

284
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.200
Is this one of your practical things?

285
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.700
Yes.

286
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.900
I have theories, too,
but they're not mystical.

287
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.800
They're derived from a large number
of observations.

288
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.800
First, do you know what the universe is?

289
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.400
What is it?

290
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.100
The universe is a hollow sphere floating in the middle of a sea of fire.

291
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.400
On its surface are numerous tiny holes
and a large hole.

292
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.800
The light from the sea of fire
shines through these holes.

293
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.000
The tiny ones are stars,
and the large one is the sun.

294
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
We can see the stars moving around, and the sun rising and setting, because the sphere is rotating.

295
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.200
If all the holes are fixed in
the surface of the same sphere,

296
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.600
how can you explain the relative motion
between the sun and the stars?

297
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.200
Correct.

298
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.600
That's why I've modified my model.

299
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.500
The universal sphere
is made of two spheres.

300
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.500
Come in.

301
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.900
Professor Wang, hello. Is Captain Shi here?

302
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.600
Do you think he can be
in two place at once?

303
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.680
I thought Captain Shi and you were both in the game,

304
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.850
so I came to report to him, not expecting that you sent him on an errand.

305
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.010
I was in the game just now, but I couldn't figure something out,

306
00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.450
so I logged off.

307
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.100
After Mozi told me about the theoretical structure of his giant instrument,

308
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.980
I wanted to make a simple model on the computer like this to help me to understand.

309
00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.890
Unfortunately, my ability is limited. You're just in time.

310
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.590
This is the model.

311
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:44.200
As Mozi said, the sky is the shell of the inner sphere that has many small holes.

312
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.630
Next, let's create an outer sphere that has one large hole.

313
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.040
Then add light.

314
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.680
Yes, that's it.

315
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.240
The light coming through the hole is reflected and scattered,

316
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.000
filling the space between the two spheres with light.

317
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.250
Then the light comes in through the tiny holes and that's how we see the stars.

318
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.300
The theory sounds great.

319
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.930
But what about the sun?

320
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.130
I asked Mozi about it.

321
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:21.650
He said, the sun is the result of the large hole in the outer sphere being projected onto the inner one.

322
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.130
The projection is so bright that it penetrates the inner sphere

323
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.850
like the shell of an egg, and that is how we see the sun.

324
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.610
Around the spot of light, the bright reflected light rays light up the inner shell.

325
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.610
That's the clear sky we see during the day.

326
00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.270
It's a bold hypothesis.

327
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.860
But there should be a force that propels the two spheres in irregular motion

328
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.020
to make it appropriate to the circumstances.

329
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.740
According to Mozi, the force is the sea of fire outside the universe.

330
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.980
It's unreasonable.

331
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.650
In the double-shell model,

332
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:59.690
if the sun is the projection of the hole in the outer shell, its size and brightness ought to be fixed.

333
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.160
When I asked the question, Mozi looked disdainful.

334
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.030
He said my conception of this model was too simplistic.

335
00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:12.680
As conditions in the sea of fire change, the outer shell will shrink or expand.

336
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.450
This leads to changes in the size and brightness of the sun.

337
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.960
That sounds reasonable.

338
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.000
Professor Wang, do you have any other questions?

339
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.030
What about the flying stars?

340
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.930
Flying stars?

341
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.020
Yes.

342
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.650
The model doesn't take flying stars into consideration.

343
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.010
Excuse me.

344
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.960
- Hello. 
 - <i>Hello.</i>

345
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.500
Don't talk nonsense.

346
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.920
<i>Though the game is different from other games, it can't beat me.</i>

347
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.860
I've found that the biggest difference in the game...

348
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.730
is the sun.

349
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:11.960
But it's complicated to explain.

350
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.650
Ms. Xu, would you please come over?

351
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.100
<i>OK.</i>

352
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.440
Professor Wang, I'm going to see Sha Ruishan.

353
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.510
I don't want to waste the five sets of V-suits.

354
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.900
OK.

355
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.030
How do you like it? Is it tasty?

356
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.200
Yes.

357
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.880
Where is Captain Shi?

358
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.920
Babysitting my daughter.

359
00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.160
What else do you want to do? Tell Uncle.

360
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.920
Let's go skating, shall we?

361
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.160
Mom says skating is dangerous.

362
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.740
It isn't a good sport for my age.

363
00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.480
Professor Wang, are you not worried?

364
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.200
Why is skating dangerous?

365
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.260
For your age...how old are you? It isn't dangerous with me by your side.

366
00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.020
Uncle, you're so cool.

367
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.480
Am I cool?

368
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.270
Actually, I'm not cool.

369
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.680
When my son was little, I wouldn't let him go skating.

370
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.940
But I regret it now.

371
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.920
I shouldn't have stopped him.

372
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.810
Who knows what will happen tomorrow, right?

373
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.200
Uncle, no smoking indoors.

374
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.580
OK.

375
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.750
Let's go skating.

376
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.050
Go.

377
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.360
Why do you care about the flying stars?

378
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.820
They're not important.

379
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.060
Just some dust flying about the inside of the universal spheres.

380
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.300
No, the flying stars are important.

381
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.780
How does your model explain the sudden extinguishing of the sun during the time of Confucius?

382
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.200
That's a rare exception.

383
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.410
Maybe it was because a dark spot or cloud in the sea of fire

384
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.480
happened to pass over the big hole in the outer shell.

385
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.790
My universe model has proved that.

386
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:12.240
Is this model the machine you built to replicate the universe?

387
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.350
Yes.

388
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.910
Yes, exactly.

389
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.960
The light source is made of the luminescent material

390
00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.210
gathered from hundreds of thousands of fireflies.

391
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.750
I used a cool light so that the clerk can stay inside for a long time.

392
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.400
There's a person inside the sphere?

393
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.070
Sure, the clerk is important.

394
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.430
After we set up the model to correspond to the current state of the real universe,

395
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.980
the future state of the universe will be accurately simulated.

396
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.200
Of course, the sun's motion can be simulated, too.

397
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.130
The clerk will record everything.

398
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.240
What's this?

399
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.790
Your observation records?

400
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:10.310
The records are a precise calendar.

401
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:16.650
This is the dream of hundreds of civilizations before us.

402
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.740
Hairen, you've come in time.

403
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:29.000
According to the model universe, a four-year-long Stable Era is about to begin.

404
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.120
Emperor Wu of Han has issued the order to rehydrate based on my prediction.

405
00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:37.640
Let's wait and see.

406
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:48.000
You can open the interface and speed up the time.

407
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.270
A Stable Era has begun.

408
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.500
Proper temperature, the spring of civilization.

409
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.020
Do you not want to join this wonderful life?

410
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.770
When women are revived, they crave love.

411
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.890
There is no reason for you to stay here any longer.

412
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.160
The game is over.

413
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.820
I am the winner.

414
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.320
Your model universe is indeed incomparable.

415
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.570
But as for its predictions...

416
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.370
May I use the telescope to observe the sun?

417
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.790
Of course.

418
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.510
Please.

419
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.780
Wait.

420
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:23.030
To observe the sun, you need this smoked glass filter.

421
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:35.060
Look, the sun is an entity with a small core in its middle.

422
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.850
The core is actually the sun.

423
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.160
Around it is the light that it gives off.

424
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.440
Maybe it's just a visual error.

425
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.750
Let's speed it up again for the good of observation.

426
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.920
It seems that the sun will probably not rise again.

427
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.790
It's like the end of Civilization No. 137.

428
00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.440
My predictions cannot be wrong.

429
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.890
Look, the golden earth.

430
00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.850
It isn't the horizon.

431
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.650
It's the sun!

432
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.080
It's about to end.

433
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.640
Dehydrate!

434
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.490
- Dehydrate!
- Dehydrate!

435
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.920
Dehydrate!

436
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.160
Dehydrate! Dehydrate!

437
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.650
Dehydrate!

438
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.800
Mozi, we should dehydrate, too.

439
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.400
No.

440
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.600
No need.

441
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.600
The Stable Era will continue!

442
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.600
The universe is a machine!

443
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.300
I created this machine!

444
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.100
Mozi!

445
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.500
(Civilization No. 141
fell into ruins in flames.)

446
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.200
(This civilization had advanced to
the Eastern Han Period.)

447
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.000
(The seed of civilization remains.)

448
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.400
(It will germinate and again progress through the unpredictable world of Three-Body.)

449
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.200
(We invite you to log in
to the game again.)

450
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.000
Flying stars.

451
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.800
Flying stars.

452
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.000
Doudou.

453
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.100
Who bought you the ice cream?

454
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.800
I-I only had one.

455
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.200
Shi Qiang, You bought my daughter
an ice cream, didn't you?

456
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.000
I didn't smoke.

457
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.790
What did you have for dinner?

458
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.100
- Stewed assorted giblets.
- Steaks.

459
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.500
Stewed steaks?

460
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.000
I didn't smoke.

461
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.500
Uncle took me on roller skating.

462
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.800
Anyway, I didn't smoke.

463
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.000
Fine.

464
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.000
I shouldn't have believed you.

465
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.600
Give me.

466
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.800
What are you doing?

467
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.800
Give me my car key.

468
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.000
Have you found anything new
in the game?

469
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.400
Let me send her home first.

470
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.400
You must have got something, right?

471
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.800
Yes. Let me think about it.

472
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.200
Doudou, let's go.

473
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.000
What, what...

474
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.400
What are the flying stars?
You just said that.

475
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.600
Your hands are so cold.

476
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.100
I can't believe that I witnessed
the destruction of Mozi's civilization.

477
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.200
What a great phenomena!

478
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.300
Great!

479
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.400
The game is so great!

480
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.600
How come?

481
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.400
I can't explain it to you now.

482
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.200
I recommend you to read
some books and papers in this field,

483
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.600
like 900 Million Suns,
Structure and Evolution of Stars, etc.

484
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.600
I'll make a list for you later.

485
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.400
By the way, I asked them to express the four sets of V-suits back to you.

486
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.400
If you told me what the game was like early, I wouldn't have let them team with me.

487
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.000
Those guys only know to kill mobs.

488
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
How could they play
such an advanced game?

489
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.800
Fortunately, I didn't log on earlier.

490
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.800
If I did, I might have been
killed by your partners.

491
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.300
Come on.

492
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.500
Get to the point.

493
00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.400
Guys.

494
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.600
You've been
playing this game for some time.

495
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.700
Our goal today is that you tell me about it and make sure every word is understandable to me.

496
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.400
That will be enough, OK?

497
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.800
Come on.

498
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.000
In this game, civilizations advance briefly in Stable Eras,

499
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.400
while in Chaotic Eras, they stop developing, or even get destroyed.

500
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.400
So the players' task is to find the appearance regularity of the Stable Eras.

501
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.100
Understood.

502
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.200
Just like the four seasons.

503
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.600
The ancient must sum up the laws of seasonal changes for the good of agricultural production.

504
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:50.000
The ancient calendar and solar terms
were their summaries of the laws

505
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.600
to help people to sow seeds in spring, harvest in autumn, store grains and live through winter.

506
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.100
Understood.

507
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.700
But the sun's motion in the game isn't as easy to master as the changes in the seasons.

508
00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.700
The alternation between the Stable Eras
and the Chaotic Eras is random.

509
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.800
Like earthquakes, with today's science and technology, we still can't predict them.

510
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:21.400
- So, you'll pass the game as long as you can predict the Stable Eras. 
 - Right.

511
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.500
Then do it.

512
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.100
All the players were doing it.

513
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.900
King Wen of Zhou
predicted the Stable Eras by divination.

514
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:36.800
The people of Civilization No. 139 traveled across the whole world to observe the sun.

515
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.700
Confucius predicted them
by order and propriety.

516
00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.600
Mozi tried to predict the Stable Eras with
the giant universe model he built.

517
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.300
All of them craved a precise calendar.

518
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.800
Understood.

519
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.000
They worked hard,
but they didn't succeed.

520
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
How come?

521
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.600
Because the world of Three-Body
is different from ours.

522
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.300
What's the difference?

523
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.800
- The sun.
- The sun.

524
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.600
Confidant.

525
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.000
What's wrong with the sun this time?

526
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.500
It suddenly appeared in front of us,
humongous.

527
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.800
I don't understand.

528
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.700
In other words, as if in our world, the sun just rose at dawn,

529
00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:27.900
but one second later, precisely one second later, it jumped to the position of noon.

530
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:34.800
And according to Mozi, in the time of Confucius, the sun went out all of a sudden.

531
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.500
He still doesn't understand.

532
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.000
Look.

533
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.800
Hypothetically, this was the sun
in the time of Confucius.

534
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.800
It went out all of a sudden.

535
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.000
Does the sun have a switch?

536
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.400
That's impossible.

537
00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.600
But the sun can move.

538
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.100
It can move away from
or close to us very fast,

539
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.400
as fast as if it is switched on or off.

540
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.100
Understood.

541
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:14.000
In the time of Confucius,
the sun moved away very fast.

542
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
In the time of Mozi,
the sun came close very fast.

543
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.400
Exactly.

544
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.000
And Mozi disclosed
very important information.

545
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.500
In the time of Confucius, after the sun went out suddenly, a flying star appeared in the sky.

546
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.000
If it was true,
I think there is only one possibility.

547
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000
After the sun went out, the flying star that was originally covered by the sun's rays became visible.

548
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.100
I don't understand.

549
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.000
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yes.

550
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.800
Find me one.

551
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.300
That's the sun.

552
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.300
This is the flying star.

553
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.200
We can't see it.

554
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.200
The sun's light is so strong
that it overshadows the flying star.

555
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.710
But after the sun goes out,

556
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.300
Look, the flying star appears.

557
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.300
There must be some connection.

558
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.700
But I haven't figured it out yet.

559
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.400
I need further observation
to figure it out.

560
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.000
Can the sun move that fast?

561
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
It's impossible.

562
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.200
In the world of Three-Body,
it's possible.

563
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.000
Understood.

564
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.600
It makes me a bit uncomfortable
turning it off. Turn it on.

565
