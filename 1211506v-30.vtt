3
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.840
There are thousands of

4
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.870
listening posts like this
in Trisolarans' world.

5
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.230
Are there thousands of scientists
like Ye Wenjie here?

6
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.400
We are not scientists.

7
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.710
This world has received your message.

8
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.310
I am a pacifist in this world.

9
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.950
(It is the luck of your civilization)

10
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.790
(that I am the first
to receive your message.)

11
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.510
(I'm warning you: Do not answer.)

12
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.510
(Do not answer!)

13
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.240
(Do not answer!)

14
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.010
As long as there is no answer,
the position of Earth

15
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.960
cannot be locked by the Trisolaran.

16
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.240
He betrayed Trisolaran.

17
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.650
Why?

18
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.150
The policy we have established is that

19
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.560
after the Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet
occupies the solar system and the Earth,

20
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.470
the earthmen can completely
live as before.

21
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.680
Only one thing is forbidden forever,

22
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.400
procreation.

23
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.750
I want you to know that

24
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.240
(you will not be able to)

25
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.750
(save the Earth
that holds all your hopes.)

26
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.710
(I will let you live
until the day it loses all hope.)

27
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.430
Set sail immediately
after the Fleet is built,

28
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.500
and head in that direction.

29
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.840
We can tell from this gaming session
that Three-Body has indeed never

30
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.090
imparted any technologies
more advanced than ours to Earth.

31
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.000
Just as Ye Wenjie conjectured.

32
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.520
But their technologies
are very advanced.

33
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.750
There are over 1,000 listening posts
like Post No. 1379.

34
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.900
Compared with them, we're virtually…

35
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.620
It's indeed like the farmer
and the turkeys.

36
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.130
Chang,

37
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.590
they're trying as hard as they can
to search for alien civilizations.

38
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.310
They're desperate to move home.

39
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.080
Yeah.

40
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.130
But there's one thing I find confusing.

41
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.870
Like us, they send signals
by means of electromagnetic waves.

42
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.120
Judging from the level
of their science and technology,

43
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120
they should've long since discovered

44
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.430
that fixed stars are amplifiers
for electromagnetic waves,

45
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.430
but why have we still not
received any messages from Trisolaris?

46
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.310
Think about the information we have.

47
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.000
The three suns of Centaurus
are actually shrouded in a gigantic

48
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.630
plasmatic atmosphere.

49
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.000
The atmosphere will turn their three suns
into flying stars without warning

50
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.430
or display flying stars.

51
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.870
Are you saying the atmosphere
blocks radio waves?

52
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.310
Yeah.

53
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.750
This meant that in order
to reach the energy mirrors,

54
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.630
the waves would have to be more powerful
than a threshold value,

55
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.480
so you can no longer use the sun
as an antenna to broadcast radio waves.

56
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480
You can only use an antenna
on the ground to do that.

57
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.000
Even if the environmental conditions
are too poor,

58
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.720
with their science and technology,
they can totally find a way

59
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120
to transmit signals
without using a fixed star.

60
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.950
That's indeed possible. Maybe they have
more advanced technologies,

61
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.190
but it's also possible they've never
transmitted anything.

62
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.060
But there's no way
we can find the answer in this game.

63
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.950
Guys, so far,
the world that this game shows us

64
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.000
is total imagination of ETO members
based on the information they have.

65
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.360
We need to differentiate and analyze

66
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.820
all the realistic details with care.

67
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.040
Just like the princeps's residence.

68
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.480
It might be a pyramid.

69
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.160
Or it might be something else.

70
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.800
It can be on the ground, or underground.

71
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.390
All these are our speculations
and imagination.

72
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.070
But only one thing is certain.

73
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.040
There's a thick wall separating it
from the outside world

74
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.040
so as to protect him
against the extreme weather.

75
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.720
The princeps strikes me
as pretty badass.

76
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.310
The knowledge that he might get a new home
didn't exhilarate him.

77
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.750
And the knowledge that the monitor

78
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.630
replied to Ye Wenjie's message
didn't anger him much.

79
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.430
I don't know much about his personality.

80
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.310
But I definitely
wouldn't be able to do that.

81
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.680
When faced with such serious matters,
he could still retain his composure.

82
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.920
- He's definitely no milksop.
- I noticed that as well.

83
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.390
I think it's unlikely
that this is a setting of the game.

84
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.830
I speculate that the Trisolarans
are actually emotionless.

85
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.390
Your speculation is very likely
to be true.

86
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.390
Think about it. In this game,
emotions such as fear,

87
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.750
sorrow, happiness,

88
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.680
and appreciation of beauty,
are all non-existent.

89
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:21.160
Because these emotions
will cause them to be spiritually weak.

90
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.630
The kind of civilization you yearn for
once existed in Trisolaran world.

91
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.270
But in the reincarnation
of all Trisolaran Civilizations,

92
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.310
this kind of civilization
is the most fragile and short-lived.

93
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.270
Judging from the history
of Trisolaran Civilization,

94
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.160
there are two mental states
that Trisolarans need.

95
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.270
One of them is calmness.

96
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.950
The other one is numbness.

97
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.510
Civilizations that relied on these
two states as their spiritual core

98
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.950
were the most capable of survival.

99
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.310
In other words, our enemies
are as cold and emotionless as steel.

100
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.560
- Yeah.
- No wonder they could think of

101
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.270
the despicable plan of forbidding humans
to reproduce.

102
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.310
But what's more despicable
is that they've locked down our science.

103
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.950
Locked down our science?

104
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.690
How did they do that?

105
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.390
(The emergency meeting of consuls
is about to start.)

106
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:21.540
(All consuls should assemble
at the Pendulum Monument.)

107
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.800
Earth civilization has made a reply.

108
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.450
They're 40,000 light-hours from us.

109
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.160
(They've only just
received Ye Wenjie's message.)

110
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.310
(Then right now it should be
1983 on Earth.)

111
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.000
(If that's true,)

112
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.190
(a Trisolaran hour
is equivalent to 0.876 earth hour.)

113
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.510
How… How do I convert that?

114
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.680
52 minutes.

115
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.390
20,000 Trisolaran hours ago,
the Trisolaran Fleet has launched.

116
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.160
But the fact is that
4.5 million hours from now,

117
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.630
(that civilization's technology
might be developing increasingly fast,)

118
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.510
(and far more advanced than ours.)

119
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.920
By then,
the Trisolaran Fleet won't even survive

120
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.040
a single blow from Earth's civilization.

121
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.510
This is not an expedition,
but a funeral procession!

122
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.360
(What's more frightening)

123
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.000
(is that the location of Trisolaris
has been exposed.)

124
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.600
(It's very possible that long before
an expanded sun swallows this planet,)

125
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
(Trisolaran Civilization will have
already been extinguished by earthmen.)

126
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.750
Given a time gap of 40,000 hours,

127
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.080
to effectively contain a civilization's development
and disarm it,

128
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.100
there is only one way:
kill its science.

129
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.550
To lock down humans' science,
they made three plans.

130
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.620
The first step.

131
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.000
You tell them.

132
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.320
The first plan

133
00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.120
is code-named Coloring.

134
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.480
(They'll use the negative effects
of science and technology)

135
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.200
(to cause the public to hate
and fear science.)

136
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.000
- On the earth, dozens of species go extinct every day.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.480
That's what Pan Han has been doing.

138
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.550
(The harm of Science to the Environment)
Are you not worried that

139
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.870
the public would resist technology
after seeing the report?

140
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.270
What people resist is the harm
that comes with technology

141
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.030
instead of technology itself.

142
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.360
Second.

143
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.080
Come on. Keep going.

144
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.320
The second plan is code-named Miracle.

145
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.630
(It's about showing signs
of supernatural power to humans,)

146
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.200
(so that unscientific ways of thinking
will dominate scientific thinking)

147
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.480
(and lead to the collapse of the entire
scientific system of thought.)

148
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.630
These two plans can only cause some
interference to our scientific development.

149
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.200
Yeah.

150
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.600
That's why they'll also
make a decisive move.

151
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.480
It'll completely suffocate science
on Earth

152
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.960
and freeze our science
at its current level.

153
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.870
They'll stop our exploration
of the deep structure of matter

154
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.270
and curb our basic science,
making it impossible for us

155
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.000
to make major breakthroughs
in science and technology as a whole.

156
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.750
Chang, Earth is not their only target.

157
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.670
I mean, before
receiving Ye Wenjie's message,

158
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.790
they had been preparing
for this all along.

159
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.080
Well, how did they do that?

160
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.240
Judging from the progress in the game,

161
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.630
they are building
a large particle accelerator.

162
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.510
Yeah.

163
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.960
They have scrapped all the plans
for building a second space fleet.

164
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.390
All resources are now devoted
to this thing.

165
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.390
It's called Project Sophon.

166
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.840
Although the Trisolaran scientists

167
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.000
can already manipulate nine
of the eleven dimensions

168
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.600
of the micro-scale world…

169
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.390
Nine?
The difference is insane, isn't it?

170
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.550
But their etching
of micro integrated circuits

171
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.440
can only be conducted
at the macro scale.

172
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.510
Your explanation is too complicated.

173
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.600
Even I cannot understand it.

174
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.720
Professor Ye once said
Trisolaris sent two protons to Earth,

175
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.150
that they'd lock down our science.

176
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.390
But she's confused as to
how they're going to do that, and so are we.

177
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.480
Maybe there will be
some kind of demonstration of it

178
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.100
at a later stage of the game.

179
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.750
It seems you guys are faced
with a long-term, arduous task.

180
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.030
Yeah, a long-term, arduous task.

181
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.320
The tricky part is
we're still unfamiliar with this task.

182
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.890
Log into the game right now.

183
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.460
General Chang,

184
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.150
when I was in the game,
I think I saw someone.

185
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.390
Yeah.

186
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.320
That was her.

187
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.510
She wanted to see

188
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.410
what the Trisolaran Civilization
was like exactly.

189
00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.550
As things stand,

190
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.670
the proton they sent to Earth
is not the kind of proton we know of.

191
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.840
It's a modified proton,
a superintelligent computer.

192
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.270
They call it Sophon.

193
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.240
It's superintelligent.

194
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.120
(Something invisible to the naked eye
can actually turn into a computer?)

195
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.080
(The Trisolarans' tones of voice just now)

196
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.510
(suggested even they themselves
couldn't imagine that.)

197
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.630
What's more unbelievable

198
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:07.010
is that this whole thing
has to start with unfolding a proton.

199
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.250
Two-dimensional unfolding of proton
starts.

200
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.120
Unfolding failed.

201
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.130
The target proton
has become one-dimensional.

202
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.770
This is what a proton looks like
after being unfolded into 3 dimensions.

203
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.240
This is a reflector.

204
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.840
Run!

205
00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.360
Run!

206
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.320
Where…

207
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.410
Where to?

208
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.170
They launched nuclear missiles.

209
00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.650
(Unfolding failed.)

210
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.320
I really can't imagine

211
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.200
how complicated the internal structure
of a subatomic particle can be.

212
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.150
It depends on the number of dimensions
of your observation perspective.

213
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.270
(From a 4-dimensional perspective,)

214
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.600
(a fundamental particle
is an immense world.)

215
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.600
(When the perspective
has been raised to 9 dimensions,)

216
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.550
(a fundamental particle's internal structures
and complexity)

217
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.840
(are equal to the whole universe.)

218
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.600
(As for even higher dimensions,)

219
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.200
our physicists haven't been able
to explore them,

220
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.360
so I cannot yet imagine
the degree of complexity.

221
00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.120
Was there intelligent life
in the micro-universe

222
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.960
within the unfolded proton?

223
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.440
Did we just destroy
a civilization in the microcosmos?

224
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.510
It was at least an intelligent body.

225
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.150
Also, Princeps,
we destroyed the entire microcosmos.

226
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.960
But this is not the first time
such a thing has happened.

227
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.270
In the long history
of scientific progress,

228
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.840
(every time the physicists
had protons collide in an accelerator,)

229
00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.120
(every time a proton or a neutron decays,)

230
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.670
(and every time a high-energy cosmic ray
enters the atmosphere,)

231
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.360
(thousands of miniature universes
may be destroyed.)

232
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.000
You're not feeling sentimental
because of this, are you?

233
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.870
I just want the people of Trisolaris
to understand

234
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.360
that the destruction of civilizations
is a common occurrence

235
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.200
(that happens every second
of every hour in the universe,)

236
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.200
because lately we've discovered
that in the world of Three-Body,

237
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.790
there are actually many
like the monitor of Post No. 1379.

238
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:57.370
We must control and eliminate
these weak sentiments.

239
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.670
There are Redemptionists among them too?

240
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:04.790
Princeps, this is mainly the result
of recent messages received from Earth.

241
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.480
Earth civilization has great appeal
on Trisolaris.

242
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.390
Their humanism will lead many Trisolarans
onto the wrong path.

243
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.870
(Just as Trisolaran Civilization
has already become a religion on Earth,)

244
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.550
(Earth Civilization has this potential
on Trisolaris.)

245
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.670
You've pointed out a great danger.

246
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:29.550
We should strictly control
the flow of information from the Earth

247
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:34.720
to the populace,
especially cultural information.

248
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.460
They're as scared of us
as we're scared of them.

249
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.720
Princeps, the unfolding is a success.

250
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.000
Look carefully.

251
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
(There are two starry skies up there.)

252
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.670
(I see it.)

253
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.310
The other starry sky is circular.

254
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.030
That constellation in there
belongs to the southern hemisphere.

255
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.790
(That's our planet.)

256
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.530
(It's another Trisolaris.)

257
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.680
That's a mirror.

258
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680
Yes.

259
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.960
(That mirror
is the proton being unfolded.)

260
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.240
(It's a geometric plane
without any meaningful depth.)

261
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.000
(Princeps, the proton plane
is being bent by our planet's gravity.)

262
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.110
(Those spots of light)

263
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.830
(are electromagnetic beams
being sent up from the ground)

264
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.110
(to adjust the curvature
of the plane under gravity.)

265
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.680
(The goal is to eventually)

266
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.270
wrap the unfolded proton completely
around Trisolaris.

267
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.790
(Afterwards, the electromagnetic beams
will continue)

268
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.310
(to hold up and stabilize this enormous sphere,
like so many spokes.)

269
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.790
(Thus, Trisolaris will be the workbench
to secure the two-dimensional proton,)

270
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.750
(and the work to etch electronic circuits
on the surface)

271
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.070
(of the proton plane can begin.)

272
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.510
Will we still get sunlight?

273
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.160
That's what I'm about to say.

274
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.000
Trisolaris will enter
the darkest night in history.

275
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.270
(All sunlight will be reflected
back into space.)

276
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.880
(The temperature will drop precipitously.)

277
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.310
(It might reach levels comparable
to the appearance of three flying stars.)

278
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.550
(Please give the order)

279
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.160
(for our people to dehydrate
and be stored.)

280
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.720
(Etching the proton circuits
is a huge project.)

281
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.160
(According to initial estimates,
it'll take 15,000 Trisolaran hours.)

282
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.680
(After its completion, we'll also
need time for software debugging.)

283
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.000
Here's my command.

284
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.220
Everybody dehydrates and gets restored.

285
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.270
(If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I would never have believed)

286
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.000
(a proton invisible to the naked eye,)

287
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.980
(after being unfolded into 2 dimensions,
can actually enfold a planet.)

288
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.510
(Those lights are spaceships)

289
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.240
(etching the integrated circuits
on the gargantuan membrane.)

290
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.920
(They're transforming the proton)

291
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.960
(into Sophon,
a superintelligent computer.)

292
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.940
(Converted to Earth time,
it's about two years.)

293
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.510
(Micro-Intelligence 2.10 loaded.)

294
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.200
(Sophon One ready to accept commands.)

295
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.640
A Sophon has been born.

296
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.510
We have endowed a proton with wisdom.

297
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.790
This is the smallest
artificial intelligence we can make.

298
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:45.960
But right now, it appears
as the largest artificial intelligence.

299
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.920
(Princeps,)

300
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.720
(we'll increase the dimensionality
of this proton.)

301
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.740
(It will soon become small.)

302
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.570
Adjust dimensionality to six.

303
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.070
Sophon One, enter the control center.

304
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.790
Our control center is deep underground.

305
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.160
Can it go through the ground?

306
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.240
Princeps, it's not exactly
going "through".

307
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.160
Rather, it's entering
from a higher dimension.

308
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.160
It can enter any enclosed space
within our world.

309
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.270
Princeps.

310
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.920
This is just the 6-dimensional body of the proton
projected into three-space.

311
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.270
Can you increase its dimensionality
to eleven,

312
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.200
and make it as small
as a regular proton?

313
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.640
Attention! This is not a command!

314
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.200
(Sophon One understands.)

315
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.000
Princeps, if we increase
the dimensionality to eleven,

316
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.240
we will lose it forever.

317
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.110
When the Sophon shrinks to the size
of a regular subatomic particle,

318
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.880
the internal sensors

319
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.240
(and I/O ports)

320
00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.110
(will be smaller than the wavelength
of any electromagnetic radiation.)

321
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.550
(That means it would not be able
to sense the macro world,)

322
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.960
(or receive our commands.)

323
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.550
But we must eventually make it shrink
back to a subatomic particle.

324
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.790
Yes, but that must await the completion

325
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.400
of Sophon Two, Sophon Three,
and Sophon Four.

326
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.530
They've built four things of this kind?

327
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.480
(Princeps,)

328
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480
(the construction of Sophon Two,
Sophon Three,)

329
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.720
(and Sophon Four have been finished.)

330
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.850
(The continuous dimensionality
has been adjusted to 11.)

331
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.550
Princeps, Sophon One and Sophon Two
will be launched toward the Earth

332
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.610
(and become high-energy particles
in a moment,)

333
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.240
(and navigate through space
at nearly the speed of light.)

334
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.680
What can Sophons do for us
after they reach Earth?

335
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.200
After the two Sophons arrive on Earth,

336
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.960
their first mission is to locate
the high-energy particle accelerators

337
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.200
used by humans for physics research

338
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.270
(and hide within them.)

339
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.270
(They'll take the place
of target particles, accept the collision,)

340
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.160
(and deliberately give out
wrong and chaotic results.)

341
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.680
No wonder these years

342
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.070
we haven't made any breakthrough
in fundamental physics.

343
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.960
(Yang Dong's experiments
didn't generate any reasonable results.)

344
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.310
(It's all because the Trisolarans)

345
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.070
(used Sophon to tamper
with our high-energy accelerator.)

346
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.880
They will remain forever
in the primitive stage.

347
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.110
The science of Earth
has been completely locked down.

348
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.200
(Sophon can also
use high-energy particles to expose film,)

349
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.830
(traveling at light speed
to project contents onto films)

350
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.550
(even retinas.)

351
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.440
(Sophons can cause
background cosmic radiation)

352
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.110
(to flicker in their eyes.)

353
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.310
(We have already written the software)

354
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.200
(to allow a Sophon to unfold itself
into two dimensions.)

355
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.480
(After the unfolding is complete,)

356
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.590
(the huge plane can wrap itself
around the Earth.)

357
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.720
(This software can also adjust the membrane
so that it's transparent,)

358
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.590
(but the degree of transparency
can be tuned in the frequencies)

359
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.000
(of the cosmic microwave background.)

360
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.920
Of course, as Sophons fold and unfold
into different dimensions,

361
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.960
they can display
even more amazing 'miracles'.

362
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.830
The software for accomplishing these
is still being developed.

363
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.920
(More than one Sophon,
by means of some quantum entanglement,)

364
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.200
(can form a system
to sense the macro world,)

365
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.160
(a formation in which
they can sense each other.)

366
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.640
(More Sophons can then form)
a mutual-sensing formation)

367
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.310
(which can sense the macro world.)

368
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.110
(Keeping Sophon Three
and Sophon Four here)

369
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:30.330
(will enable them
to receive the information sent back)

370
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.240
(by Sophon One and Sophon Two from Earth.)

371
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:38.050
(This gives us a way
to monitor Earth in real time.)

372
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.240
(The sun that had just risen
disappeared below the horizon.)

373
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.510
(It seems another Chaotic Era has begun.)

374
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.270
But

375
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:56.180
we're full of hope.

376
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.940
(Chang Weisi)

377
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.530
Comrades, please be aware

378
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:24.480
that our meeting is probably already

379
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.160
being monitored by Sophons.

380
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.550
From here on out,

381
00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:34.420
there shall be no secrets.

382
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.860
(You)

383
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.900
(are)

384
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:49.940
(are)

385
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:24.780
(You are bugs)

386
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.980
Professor Ye,

387
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.920
the 28 GB of information

388
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.900
we got from Judgment Day is all here.

389
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.180
Is there anything else you need?

390
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.770
I want

391
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.850
to revisit the Red Coast Base.

392
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.330
These words in front of my eyes

393
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.940
are really annoying.

394
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.050
You'll get used to it.

395
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.610
It doesn't matter.

396
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.420
The Trisolaran science and technology…

397
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.980
Though having seen it with my own eyes,

398
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.900
I still find it incredible.

399
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:47.380
You mean Sophon's folding and unfolding
into different dimensions, right?

400
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.480
(With our technologies,)

401
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.070
(the unfolding of an atom)

402
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:01.790
(into lower dimensions
is irreversible,)

403
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.070
(but Trisolaran scientists)

404
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.000
(can unfold it into lower dimensions)

405
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.460
(without losing its advanced
structural information,)

406
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.250
(making the process reversible.)

407
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.160
But if we want to do an experiment
like that, we can only start

408
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.640
from the 11 dimensions
of the micro-scale world, but now…

409
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.850
But now our accelerators
are useless.

410
00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.180
Her name's Lin Yun.

411
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.640
She made great contributions
to the research on ball lightning

412
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.330
and the macroatom theory.

413
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.070
At that time we thought

414
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:29.250
we'd be able to make some breakthroughs
in physics.

415
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.530
Now as I think about it,

416
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.810
it was a joke.

417
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.610
Why have I never heard of her before?

418
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.250
For some reasons, I think.

419
00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.140
There are many things you've probably
never heard of.

420
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.050
Where is she?

421
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.010
She's in a place.

422
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.940
Or maybe she's in

423
00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.180
some places.

424
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.700
The city's so busy.

425
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.940
These people…

426
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.810
What will they do?

427
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.980
It doesn't matter anymore.

428
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.610
It doesn't matter anymore.

429
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.280
What dishes did you get?

430
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.190
You drank so much.

431
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:29.340
You even bit through the beer bottles.

432
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:51.940
Do you wanna smoke?

433
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.000
I quit it.

434
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.260
I've converted to this.

435
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.190
Hey, how did you come up
with that shitty idea?

436
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.760
Those messages…

437
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.110
What difference does it make
if we look at them or not?

438
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.090
The result 400 years from now
will be the same.

439
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.400
Is it really like you say?

440
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.860
Everything's over?

441
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.230
It's over!

442
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:23.820
It's all over!

443
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.940
You can't use the accelerators

444
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.360
and can't study the structure of matter.

445
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.670
That means it's all over?

446
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.460
What do you think?

447
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.190
Technology is still
making progress, isn't it?

448
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:43.800
Maybe the ball lightning thing
you've been researching is over,

449
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.550
but hasn't Professor Wang
created the Flying Knife?

450
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.670
It's nanomaterial, right?

451
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:53.420
Imagine an ancient kingdom,
if you will.

452
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.400
Their technology is advancing as well.

453
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.150
They might invent better knives,
spears, swords,

454
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.510
and auto-repeating crossbows

455
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.670
that can shoot many arrows
like our machine guns.

456
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.880
But…

457
00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:14.030
But if they don't know that matter is made
from molecules and atoms,

458
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:16.510
they will never create missiles
and satellites.

459
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.400
Right?

460
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.150
They're limited
by their level of science.

461
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.360
I always knew you were smart.

462
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.840
You just look a bit silly.

463
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840
The study of the deep structure
of matter

464
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.960
is the foundation of the foundations
of all other sciences.

465
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.880
If there's no progress here,
everything else...

466
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.530
I'll put it your way, is bullshit.

467
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.400
You…

468
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.190
You… You're not bullshit.

469
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.570
You can still research knives,
shields, and swords.

470
00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.280
What am I going to research?

471
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.710
I'm bullshit. I'm bullshit.

472
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.380
This is a good thing.

473
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.440
We will be able to live out
the rest of our lives

474
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.320
in this way.

475
00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.230
All our despair

476
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:17.170
and all our decadence
can be justified now!

477
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.190
Because we're bugs!

478
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.590
Bugs that are about to go extinct!

479
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.760
Well said!

480
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.280
Long live bugs!

481
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.030
Long live Sophons!

482
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.130
Long live the end of the world!

483
00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.130
Good!

484
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.420
Come on!

485
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.900
Come on!

486
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.900
Bunch of cowards.

487
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.180
Nano Coward.

488
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.460
I'm talking about you!

489
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:23.170
Come on!

490
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.260
Get up!

491
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.920
Come!

492
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.150
Come with me.

493
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.590
And you.

494
00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.070
Uh…

495
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.030
Ball-lightning Coward!

496
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.000
Come on!

497
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.320
Let's go!

498
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.480
Where to?

499
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.920
Just come with me.

500
00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.710
I'm taking you somewhere.

501
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.880
Where?

502
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.710
Don't you want to drink?

503
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.510
Drinking here is so boring.

504
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.000
Let's go somewhere lively.

505
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.800
Somewhere with all kinds of people.

506
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.530
Are you coming? Bring the liquor.

507
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.880
Good.

508
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.730
Let's go.

509
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.360
(Pursuant to the laws,)

510
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.920
(Ye Wenjie committed crimes
against humanity)

511
00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.530
(and has now been sentenced
to life imprisonment.)

512
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.110
Would you like to take a break here?

513
00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.260
No need.

514
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.940
Professor Ye,

515
00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.510
you should have some rest.

516
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.550
If you lapse into critical condition,

517
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:40.190
we won't be able to
get you an ambulance.

518
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.650
It's okay.

519
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.430
I used to
be ready to stay here forever.

520
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.010
Now I care even less.

521
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.420
Let's go over there.

522
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.610
Professor Ye,

523
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.690
step back a little from the cliff.

524
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.710
Being here for the first time

525
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.610
is always a bit scary.

526
00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.130
This was the base for the antenna.

527
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:36.660
(Red Coast Base)

528
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.300
This

529
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.570
is sunset for humanity.

530
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.520
♪Just a matter of time♪

531
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.800
♪Should we say goodbye♪

532
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.290
♪Or should we keep it all♪

533
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.130
Where are we going?

534
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.860
My hometown. Not too far.

535
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.200
♪With a cost of all♪

536
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.770
♪Fireworks♪

♪You wasted it all just
to watch me burn♪

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.910
♪And on and on and on♪

539
00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.940
What did you bring us here for?

540
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.690
To look at bugs.

541
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.050
There's locust infestation here as well?

542
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.220
Every year.

543
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.000
Like the dust storms.

544
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.760
It started ten years ago.
But this year is the worst.

545
00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.730
What's this about?

546
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:47.150
I just want the two of you
to think about one thing.

547
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:53.230
Is the technological gap
between humans and Trisolarans

548
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.550
greater than the one
between locusts and humans,

549
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:59.610
or the other way around?

550
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.480
Look at them.

551
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.670
These bugs.

552
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:09.360
The gap between them and us
is far greater than the one

553
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.670
between us and the Trisolarans.

554
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.960
Humans have used everything
in their power to extinguish them:

555
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.440
every kind of poison,
aerial sprays, and…

556
00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:23.110
And introducing and cultivating
their natural predators,

557
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.030
searching for and destroying their eggs,

558
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:29.400
using genetic modification
to sterilize them.

559
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.800
Just like what the Trisolarans
did to us humans.

560
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.280
That's right!

561
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.510
We tried to burn them with fire,

562
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.510
drown them with water,
bury them with earth.

563
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.920
Every family has bug spray.

564
00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.920
Every desk has under it
something lethal to them

565
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.000
like a flyswatter.

566
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.260
To them, all those things
are nuclear missiles.

567
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.760
This long war has been going on

568
00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.090
for the entire history
of human civilization.

569
00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.580
But the outcome is still in doubt.

570
00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.500
The bugs have not been eliminated.

571
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.960
There are scientists
among these locusts too.

572
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.940
They're researching how to deal with us.

573
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:20.760
They're researching
how we produce pesticide.

574
00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.360
Of course, some of them don't care.

575
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.190
They're unaware of humans' existence.

576
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:28.880
They live in their own imagination.

577
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.630
There are soldiers
among these locusts too, and policemen.

578
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.860
Maybe they even have
Battle Command Centers,

579
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:38.150
which is why even to this day,

580
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.710
they still proudly live
between the heavens and the earth,

581
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:47.650
and their numbers have not diminished
from the time before human appeared!

582
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.630
The Trisolarans
who deemed the humans bugs

583
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.860
seemed to have forgotten one fact:

584
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:14.060
the bugs have never been truly defeated.

585
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:32.110
Come on, sweetie.

586
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.530
Put your book away.

587
00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.840
Dig in.

588
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.340
Thanks, Mom.
