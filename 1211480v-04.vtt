00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.400
I told you to investigate the abnormal things she did before her suicide.

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.288
Everything that you recorded is trivial stuff.

3
00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:20.640
Those things were her preparations for the wedding,

4
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.870
like the date of the wedding photos and the time on the wedding date.

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.570
It's no use.

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.670
It must be stopped.

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.948
She was preparing for the wedding, and had no time for her experiment.

10
00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:37.016

Never mind. I'm fine.

17
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.230
What did the so-called farmer say today?

18
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.908
It wasn't settled.

19
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.130
How about I consult my colleague in the psychiatry department about your symptoms?

20

Maybe we will know the reason.

21
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.012
I went to a gathering at the Frontiers of Science the other day.

22
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.320
Many scholars were discussing the farmer hypothesis.

23
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.608
I told you that yesterday.

they were discussing these hypotheses. 
<i> [Frontiers of Science]</i>

27
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.324
But I got it now.

28
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.722
When scientists find a phenomenon that can't be explained by modern science in their research,

29
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.620
they may think of shooters and farmers.

30
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.970
It has almost become their instinct.

31
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.016
You can't understand it

32
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.550
until you really see it.

33
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.162
I don't want to see it.

34
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.432
There are so many troubles in our lives.

35
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.560
I don't want to know your hypotheses.

36
00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:23.670
All right.

37
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.850
Go to bed.

38

Why did you come to work so early?

79
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.230
Since the reaction chamber malfunctioned, I've been checking it every morning.

That's what I did at your age.

These things were all I thought about.

82
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.470
Mr. Wang. You are my role model.

What?

84
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.630
You proposed the production of the Flying Blade.

85
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.720
No one thought you could make it.

86
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.050
But only after a dozen years, you have made

87
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.600
this ultra-strong nanomaterial Flying Blade a reality.

88
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.630
Even in the field of applied physics, there are very few go-getter researchers like you.

89
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.254
I was naÃ¯ve.

90
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.850
I thought molecules can be stacked one by one

91
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:36.142
by using the molecular structure, like laying bricks for a wall.

92
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.240
<i>But I never thought that this massive resource consuming method</i>

93
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.700
<i>would make the Flying Blade become precious.</i>

94
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.810
<i>We can't put it into mass production.</i>

95
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.864
<i>It's no different from not producing it.</i>

96
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.710
<i>How does the chamber operate?</i>

97
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.850
<i>It has been operating for more than a year.</i>

98
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.170
<i>There were some malfunctions in operating, such as reduced sensor sensitivity and increased error.</i>

99
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.250
<i>It should be shut down for maintenance.</i>

100
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.650
<i>But you told us it can't be turned off.</i>

101
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.270
<i>It's pivotal to complete the third batch of synthetic combinations.</i>

102
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:20.330
<i>So all engineers are working to equip more and more supplementary correction devices on it.</i>

103
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.129
These added devices also need to be overhauled now.

Yes.

105
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:31.270

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.900
With a laser powerful enough, we can project an image onto the surface of the moon!

161
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.000
As you told me before, if it were shooters and farmers who did it,

162
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
tell them to play tricks at a scale that humans cannot!

163
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.430
The question is whether you can take it.

164
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400
I want to help you avoid Yang Dong's fate.

165
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.200
Don't scare me with Yang Dong!

166
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.800
Will you accept my challenge?!

167
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.600
<i>I will.</i>

168
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.200

169
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200

Are you planning to restart your nanomaterial project?

176
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.200
Of course.

177

When?

178
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.100
Three days from now.

Where?

181

Somewhere where you can observe the cosmic microwave background.

182

186
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.200
Are you in a bad mood?

187
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.600
If you disturb my work and life like this again, I will call the police.

188
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.300
You know what? I'm a policeman.

189
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.400
Does this research center belong to you?

190
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.800
It belongs to our country.

191
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.900
It's the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology.

192
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.600
There's no one there after six, huh?

193
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.200
They lack research spirit.

194
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.200
There's a notice posted outside.

195
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.600
The reaction chamber was stopped for maintenance.

196
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.000

197
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.500
Yeah.

198
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.800
Tell me about your countdown thing.

199
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.200

202
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.800
My symptoms were diagnosed as muscae volitantes.

203
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.100
I feel something in my eyes.

204
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.000

205
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.600
Second by second.

206
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.300
That's called flashing,

207

one of the symptoms of muscae volitantes.

208

Why are you suddenly so patient with my questions today?

209
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.400
Shi Qiang, I'm not a criminal being interrogated by you.

210
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.600
Take it easy.

211
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.800
I treat criminals even more rudely.

212

I want to work with you.

There's nothing we can work on together.

214

215
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.200
I'll give you a clue.

216
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.600
Yang Dong also stopped her experiment before suicide.

217
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.800
What a coincidence.

218
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.600
There are more coincidences.

219
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.700
The scientists who committed suicide all contacted Shen Yufei.

220
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.200
Now, she is contacting you.

221
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800
You can work with me.

222
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.100
Take my protection.

223
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.400
That's your own choice.

224
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.400
If you really suspect Shen Yufei, you can arrest her.

225
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.300
You said everyone she contacted killed themselves.

226
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.800
Did she kill them?

227
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.400
You can't prove it. There's no proof.

228
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.000
Protect me, huh?

229
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.400
If Shen Yufei wants me to die now, you can't stop her at all.

230
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.800
What did she say about that?

231
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.100
How did she threaten you?

232
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.900
She said I'm a turkey.

233
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.600
Turkey?

234
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.500

I tried to calm him down and couldn't sleep at all.

249

Eggplant.

272
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.800
Eggplant? Braised eggplant, right?

273
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.000
Yes.

274
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.400

275
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400
Meat.

276
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.600
Your mom told me that you shouldn't eat so much meat.

277
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.900
It's hard to digest.

278
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.000
How about some fish instead?

279
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.800
See?

280
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.000
- I brought a fish. 
 - Okay.

281

Even if Dong were alive, she wouldn't have had children.

290
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.546
Marriage and children were not part of her world.

291
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.600
But weren't they already planning to get married?

292
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:20.300
Maybe she changed her mind and wanted to be taken seriously as a woman.

293
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.400
But

294
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600
she didn't get out of her own world.

295

Ms. Ye, I'm sorry to reopen your sores.

Never mind.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.200
Even if you are not here, I'll still think about her.

298
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.400
Have a seat.

299
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.600
I'm going to soak the vegetables for a while.

300
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.600
These days, they use so many pesticides.

301
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.500
When I cook them for the children, I have to soak it for at least two hours.

302
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.000
- Give me back the remote.
 - No.

303
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.100
- Be careful.
 - I'm not giving it to you.

304
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.200
Give the remote back to me.

305
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.800
Slow down.

306
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.000
That's Dong's room.

307
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.200
When Dong was a child, she lived with me in Northeast China.

308
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.900
She really liked the forest and nature.

309
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:39.200
When we returned to Beijing, she also decorated our home with some elements of the forest and nature.

310
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:45.100
Her bed is lined with ura grass from Northeast China.

311
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.800
I don't know if she slept well on it.

312

It's okay.

324
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.100
Those are pictures Dong drew when she was a child.

325
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.400
Is it made of birch-bark?

326
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:55.000
The birch-bark faded from silver-white...

327
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
to dark-yellow because of time.

328
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.000
You even dated the pictures for her.

329
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.800
It was drawn in 1982.

330
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.400
Right.

331
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.000
1982.

332
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.800
She was three.

333
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:20.400
Usually, children of that age draw abstract lines and shapes

334
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.000
to express their feelings.

335
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.700
I didn't teach Dong...

336
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.600
from simple to complex.

337
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.300
I exposed her too early to some very abstract, very extreme topics.

338
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.000
That's normal in families of researchers.

339
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.600
But she expressed an interest in abstract thinking at an early age.

340
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.300
I wanted to stop her.

341
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:56.500
I told her that field wasn't easy for researchers.

342
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.600
Guess what she said?

343
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.136
<i> What about Madame Curie?</i>

344
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.100
<i> I told her, Madame Curie was never really deep into that field.</i>

345
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.800
Her success ascribed to her persistence and hard work,

346
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800
but without her, someone else would have done her work.

347
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.200
Later, I discovered that she really was different from other kids.

348
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.500
For example, when it comes to a new formula,

349
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.100
other children might say, "What a wonderful formula!"

350
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:44.400
But she would say... 
<i>- What a beautiful formula!</i>

351
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.600
It was like she was looking at a pretty flower.

352
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.400
Then I realized that she may see

353
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.900
figures and formulas in a different way than others do.

354
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.800
Are these records also Yang Dong's?

355
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.200
Those were her father's.

356
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:14.200
She listened to all of them and finally picked a record by Bach and repeatedly listened to it.

357
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.000
This...

358
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.500
I was confused.

359
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.200
The music played by Bach

360
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.900
may not attract children, especially girls.

361
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:33.589
At first, I thought she was attracted by this kind of music on a whim,

362
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.400
but when I asked her how she felt about the music...

363
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.600
<i> Do you like listening to this music?</i>

364
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:44.400
<i>I can see in the music a giant is building a large, complex house.</i>

365
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.700
<i>Bit by bit, he is building it slowly.</i>

366
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.900
<i>When the music is over, the house is done.</i>

367
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.400
You educated Yang Dong very well.

368
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.600
No.

369
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.500
I'm a terrible mother.

370
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.600
<i>Her world was too simple.</i>

371
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.000
<i>All she had were ethereal theories.</i>

372
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.800
<i>Once they collapsed,</i>

373
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:29.200
<i>she had nothing to lean on to keep on living.</i>

374
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.600
<i>Physics doesn't exist.</i>

375
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.000
Ms. Ye, I can't agree with you.

376
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.800
Recently, events are happening that are beyond our imagination.

377
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.600
It's unprecedented to challenge theories in the field.

378
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.300
She's not the only scientist to wade in this field.

379
00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.000
But she was the only woman.

380
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.000
Women should be like water,

381
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.000
flowing through everything.

382
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.600
<i>Granny, I'm hungry.</i>

383
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.700
<i>Granny, I'm hungry.</i>

384
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.200
Ms. Ye, sorry for bothering you.

385
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.800
Let's have lunch together.

386
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.600
No, thanks.

387
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.000
Well, let me walk you out.

388
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.100
Ms. Ye.

389
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.800
I would like to ask you one more thing.

390
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.200
Do you know where I can observe the cosmic microwave background?

391
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.600
There are two places in China that work on it.

392
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.800
One is the Urumqi Observatory.

393
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.800
I remember it was a project

394
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.600
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Space Environment Observation Center.

395
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.000
The other one is nearby.

396
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.300
This radio astronomy observatory located in the suburbs of Beijing,

397
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.900
which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences

398
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.200
and Peking University's Joint Center for Astrophysics.

399
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.000
It's for receiving data from satellites.

400
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
I have a former student working there.

401
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.600
When do you want to go there?

402
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.600
Early morning on the 14th.

403
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.600
I'll make a call for you.

404
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.040
<i>Hello?</i>

405
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.300
<i>I'm Ye Wenjie.</i>

406
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.000
<i>Well, my friend wants to go to your observatory tomorrow.</i>

407
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.700
<i>Will you be there?</i>

408
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.000
<i>That's great.</i>

409
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.800
<i>All right. All right.</i>

410
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.200
My student's name is Sha Ruishan.

411
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.700
He will be on the night shift tomorrow. 
<i> [Bulaotun Village, Miyun Reservoir North Shore]</i>

412
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.800
It's the address.

413
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800
Wang.

414
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.000
It's not your field of research, right?

415
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.100
I have some things to figure out.

416
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.972
You look pale.

417
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.400
Recently, I haven't slept very well.

418
00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400
I'll be fine after some rest.

419
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.300
Wait a minute.

420
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.500
A few days ago, an old friend from the base brought a gift for me.

421
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.700
Here you are. 
 <i>[Red Ginseng]</i>

422
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.800
No, Ms. Ye.

423
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.000
It's cultivated, not very precious.

424
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.300
I have high blood pressure and can't eat it.

425
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.600
Take it.

426
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.200
You can slice it and make it into ginseng tea.

427
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.300
You're still young, but you have to take care of yourself.

428
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.500
Take it.

429
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.100
Thank you, Ms. Ye.

430
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.000
I'll take it.

431
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.244
Professor Wang.

432
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.440
Professor Wang, where are you going?

433
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.510
Stop stalking me.

434
00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.210
No.

435
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.210
No taxis are available now.

436
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.840
The drivers are changing their shifts.

437
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.980
Do you need a ride?

438
00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.990
See?

439
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:17.990
It didn't stop.

440
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.010
I want to ask you something.

441
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.122
Did you go to visit Yang Dong's mother?

442
00:34:30.122 --> 00:34:33.266
It's not a duty for her normal friend.

443
00:34:33.266 --> 00:34:35.574
Let alone you are not friends.

444
00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:41.022
I know you educated people often infatuate with an out of reach muse.

445
00:34:41.022 --> 00:34:43.150
Is Yang Dong like this in your heart?

446
00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:44.850
Goddess, right?

447
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.264
Can you show her some respect?

448
00:34:49.264 --> 00:34:50.960
Speak no ill of the dead.

449
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.480
I have nothing to do with Yang Dong.

450
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.900
You're shameless.

451
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.000
How can you offend her to achieve your goal?

452
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.074
Come on.

453
00:34:59.074 --> 00:35:01.950
What did you guys talk about? Tell me.

454
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.484
Why should I tell you?

455
00:35:04.484 --> 00:35:07.742
Ms. Ye is too calm.

456
00:35:07.742 --> 00:35:10.030
Calmness is a necessary quality for a scientist.

457
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.830
As a mother, she is too calm.

458
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.268
What exactly do you want to say? Just say it.

459
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.504
The daughter she brought up committed suicide.

460
00:35:19.504 --> 00:35:21.520
<i> Shouldn't she be overwhelmed?</i>

461
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.190
<i> But at her daughter's funeral, she was too calm, as if nothing special had happened.</i>

462
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.880
<i> Think about your daughter.</i>

463
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.220
I don't think something was wrong.

464
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.220
If you are good at observation and judgment, police will lose their jobs.

465
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.486
If you're really so talented, why do you need me?

466
00:35:37.486 --> 00:35:40.850
My greatest talent is finding you.

467
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.290
No taxi. You can't get it.

468
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.000
What are you doing?

469
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.930
Let's go. Dinner's on me.

470
00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.560
That's great.

471
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:09.410
<i> Integrated information service and rescue system for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.</i>

472
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:12.150
What else did Ye Wenjie say to you?

473
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.750
No more.

474
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.590
Did she give it to you?

475
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.030
Her old friend in the base brought it to her.

476
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:27.034
So, your conversation can be concluded that Yang Dong was a special woman,

477
00:36:27.034 --> 00:36:28.530
right?

478
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.730
Yes.

479
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.840
That's a very emotional conclusion.

480
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.760
No reference value.

481
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.132
I'm not your scout.

482
00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.320
<i> I thought you invited me to dinner to show your sincerity for working with me.</i>

483
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.000
<i> I'm sorry you're making a mistake.</i>

484
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.150
<i> I want to get rid of you.</i>

485
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.510
<i>I answered your questions in detail.</i>

486
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.440
<i> So if you're going to stalk me again, I'll have to call the police.</i>

487
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.320
<i> Come on.</i>

488
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.220
<i> I'm a policeman.</i>

489
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.110
<i> Besides, you have said it many times.</i>

490
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.920
<i> You didn't have to pay for my dinner.</i>

491
00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.509
<i> So, you must have something else to tell me, or you may have something to ask me.</i>

492
00:37:09.509 --> 00:37:10.950
<i> Am I right?</i>

493
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.730
<i> Go ahead.</i>

494
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.090
<i> You said that everyone who connected with Shen Yufei committed suicide.</i>

495
00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.030
<i> Is Yang Dong among them?</i>

496
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.540
<i> Yes.</i>

497
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.680
General. The European Combat Zone informed us

498
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:36.212
to attend a video meeting of global combat zones 15 minutes from now.

499
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.530
- Is it a team? 
 - Yes.

500
00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.500
This is an astronomical observation team from Helsinki. Nine in total.

501
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.530
Nine. Oh my god.

502
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.724
Set up the video conference.

503
00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.100
<i> The European Combat Zone is connected.</i>

504
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:59.350
The African Combat Zone is connected.

505
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.000
This is the North American Sector.

506
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.120
We just received the report that yesterday, nine more scientists committed suicide.

507
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.600
It was a physics research team from Helsinki conducting accelerator experiments.

508
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.319
We tried to intervene, but we were too late.

509
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.644
Nine more scientists in one day.

510
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.280
There are so many scientists who have contacted Shen Yufei.

511
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.740
Why are you only investigating Yang Dong?

512
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.590
I have investigated all of them.

513
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.930
Would you be interested in the results?

514
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.110
No.

515
00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.550
I'm not interested in anyone.

516
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.960
I told you.

517
00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.588
I've only met Yang Dong once and know little about her research.

518
00:38:40.588 --> 00:38:45.570
Among the dead scientists, she was the closest to me, so I had a reaction.

519
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:48.200
How could my reaction have anything to do with your investigation?

520
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.040
Why are you so excited?

521
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:59.460
Don't you want to know how Shen Yufei contacted Yang Dong?

522
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.880
I think you want to know about it.

523
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.610
Scientists committed suicide before...

524
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.280
<i>According to the preliminary evidence, the victim was Yang Dong.</i>

525
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.780
<i> Professor David of Gadayork University committed suicide a month ago.</i>

526
00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:17.316
They all contacted Shen Yufei.

527
00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:26.692
<i>I've investigated Yang Dong's relationships and social circle.</i>

528
00:39:26.692 --> 00:39:30.168
<i> But I haven't found any connection between her and Shen Yufei.</i>

529
00:39:30.168 --> 00:39:36.554
<i> Until eight months ago, when Yang Dong picked up a call from Shen Yufei's company.</i>

530
00:39:36.554 --> 00:39:40.546
<i> So I went to the cafÃ© where Yang Dong often went to investigate</i>

531
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.186
<i> and got its hard disk that was used for video monitoring.</i>

532
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:19.838
<i> I finally found the video of their meeting.</i>

533
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.306
What did they talk about?

534
00:40:23.306 --> 00:40:25.420
It's a silent video.

535
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.252
I saw Shen Yufei giving a folder to Yang Dong.

536
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.712
<i> But we didn't find it in her things.</i>

537
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.674
It's not weird.

538
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.420
They are scientists and have common topics.

539
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.700
It's normal for them to talk about something.

540
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:57.278
But five days after they met, Yang Dong committed suicide.

541
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.860
What? Are you scared now?

542
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:35.518
<i>I'm not.</i>

543
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.950
<i>Fear springs from ignorance.</i>

544
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.560
<i>Braveness springs from ignorance, too.</i>

545
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:49.130
<i>Scientists who committed suicide all contacted Shen Yufei.</i>

546
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.702
<i>Now, she is contacting you.</i>

547
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.070
What will happen at the end of the countdown?

548
00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.630
<i>As you told me before, if it were shooters and farmers who did it,</i>

549
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.020
<i>tell them to play tricks at a scale that humans cannot.</i>

550
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.560
<i> Three days from now. that's the fourteenth, from one to five in the morning...</i>

551
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.260
<i> from one to five in the morning...</i>

552
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.000
<i>the entire universe... will flicker for you.</i>

553
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.900
<i> Dr. Shen, has it ever occurred to you that such a statement can kill?</i>

554
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.052
<i> The turkeys on the farm</i>

555
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.520
<i>are meant to die on Thanksgiving Day.</i>

556
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.610
Daddy.

557
00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.530
Doudou, why are you at home?

558
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.458
Classes were over.

559
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:05.200
I totally forgot that.

560
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.370
I just broke a glass by accident.

561
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.210
I'm not scaring you, am I?

562
00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.590
Daddy. Our school will hold a lecture on Friday.

563
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:17.642
My teacher knows that you are a physicist and wants you to be here.

564
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.780
Friday?

565
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.900
I'll try to make it.

566
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.510
You can go back to your room and do your homework.

567
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.330
What do you think about the farmer hypothesis and shooter hypothesis?

568
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.200
That's the Frontiers of Science.

569
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.260
I thought human science had no boundaries.

570
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.438
Think about ancient Chinese mythology and ancient Greek mythology.

571
00:44:33.438 --> 00:44:36.964
They were all farmers that people imagined.

572
00:44:36.964 --> 00:44:42.590
Maybe they were scared of them, but now those can be explained with science.

573
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.460
To put it bluntly,

574
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.960
fear springs from ignorance.

575
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.410
Did Yang Dong have fear?

576
00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:55.470
She had nothing to fear.

577
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.588
Her world was only about physics.

578
00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.178
Physics doesn't exist.

579
00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.000
That was terrible news for her.
