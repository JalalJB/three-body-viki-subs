82
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.200
You didn't look right before.

83
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.300
And look at how much you're sweating.

84
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.900
The air-conditioner isn't on.

85
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.300
And the door was closed. It was just the hot air.

86
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.800
I'll be fine after I let in some fresh air. I'm all right.

Wang Miao, what's the matter with your pictures?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.000
There's numbers on them.

90
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.800
Don't touch that!

91
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.200
What's wrong with you?

92
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.000
You look so uptight.

93
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.800
What, I can't touch it?

94
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.200
I'm studying how the number got on the pictures.

95
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.600
It was printed on the picture, wasn't it?

96
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200
No, the number was on it when it was developed.

97
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.000
Well, it was on the film then.

98
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.500
Those are real-time numbers.

99
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.600
It's the camera's function.

100
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.600
A basic function of all modern cameras.

101
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.200
What is the image-forming principle?

102
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.200
What makes it photosensitive?

103
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.800
The photosensitive source of the greatest possibility

104
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.600
is an external gamma-ray with strong penetration power.

105
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.000
But it is technologically impossible.

106
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.800
Where is the source of the ray then?

107
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.600
How can it be so precise?

108
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.200
It's right on the film.

109
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.600
All right, then. You take your time researching it.

110
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.200
I'm going to go make dinner.

111
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.700
I'll let you know when it's ready.

112
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.400
Don't close the door again.

Listenâ€¦ Take a picture of the bear.

- Youâ€¦
- One, two, three.

168
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.440
Here, Doudou, let's swap cameras.

169
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.540
We'll take another picture of the bear.

170

252
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.110
Look right.

253
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.730
Up.

254
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.020
It seems to be okay.

255
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.528
But I'm really seeing things.

256
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.840
Listen, an old classmate of mine, Zhou Nan, is an eye doctor at Tongren Hospital.

257
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.130
Go see him tomorrow.

258
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.510
Have him take a look at you.

259
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.370
Get up and be there early.

260
00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.130
So he can see you before work hours.

261
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.940
If I tell you that after I close my eyes, I'm still seeing things,

262
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.960
is it possible that it's not about eyes?

263
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.608
I'm a doctor.

264
00:25:23.608 --> 00:25:25.980
We'll look into all the possibilities.

265
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.070
First, ophthalmology. Then neurology.

266
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.570
We'll eventually find a reason.

267
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.450
Hope so.

268
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.380
I hope so.

269
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.760
Go to sleep.

270
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.544

Still here, no?

274
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.566
The medical term is foreign body sensation.

275
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.870
It's not that.

276
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.480
I'm seeing a clear image.

277
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.144
If it's not supposed to be in your eyes, it's a foreign body then.

278
00:26:51.144 --> 00:26:53.022
Muscae volitantes.

279
00:26:53.022 --> 00:26:55.920
It's a common eye disease that can happen to people our age.

280
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.850
Vitreous opacity.

281
00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.610
It's a difficult one to cure.

282
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.720
But it's no big deal.

283
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.780
I'll prescribe you some eyewash and Vitamin D.

284
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.480
Maybe it'll take care of it.

285
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.484
But the probability isn't high.

286
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.580
You mentioned muscae volitantes.

287
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.144
What will the patients see?

288
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.114
It varies from person to person.

289
00:27:24.114 --> 00:27:26.200
Some see small black dots.

290
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.252
Some see tadpole-shaped objects.

291
00:27:29.252 --> 00:27:31.770
What if I say I see a string of numbers?

292
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.572
3.1415926?

293
00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:39.666
I'm not joking.

294
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.822
Seriously, a string of numbers is in the middle of my field of vision.

295
00:27:45.822 --> 00:27:47.670
You are exhausted.

296
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480
Li Yao talked to me about you at our last classmate reunion party.

297
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.004
She said that you were too stressed at work.

298
00:27:55.004 --> 00:27:58.200
We're not young anymore. We need to take things easy.

299
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.022
You can't afford to hurt your health.

300
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:08.266
So you mean it's a mental disease?

301
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.782
I would advise others to try the department of psychiatry, but that's unnecessary for you.

302
00:28:16.782 --> 00:28:18.500
You're just exhausted.

303
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.890
Take some days off.

304
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.982
Enjoy a vacation with Li Yao

305
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.020
and your daughter.

306
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.410
By the way, what's her name?

307
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:28.710
Doudou, right?

308
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.400
Go have fun together.

309
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.270
Trust me.

310
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.610
You'll be fine soon.

311
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.160
It's a countdown like this.

312
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.320
Right in front of my eyes.

313
00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.430
The countdown keeps going second by second.

314
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.328
Is it a mental disease?

315
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:55.186
You want to know how mental stress can affect your eyes?

316
00:28:55.186 --> 00:29:00.114
Last month, I saw a girl about 15-16 years old.

317
00:29:00.114 --> 00:29:02.720
She just couldn't see anything for no reason in the classroom.

318
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.908
Went totally blind.

319
00:29:04.908 --> 00:29:09.590
She had a full examination, but her eyes were completely okay physically.

320
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.280
And then, she received a one month of therapy from the experts in the psychiatry department.

321
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.138
Then all of a sudden, she got her eyesight back.

322
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.680
No other organic disease whatsoever.

323
00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.790
It's called muscae volitantes, you know.

324

I'm serious, Zhou Nan.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.610
But the medical records can back me up as well.

327
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.100
Li Yao is a doctor, too.

328
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.476
If you don't believe me, you can ask her.

Zhou Nan told me that muscae volitantes is a tricky one to treat.

335
00:31:32.352 --> 00:31:34.370
But it won't cause much trouble in life.

336
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.758
So don't worry about it.

337
00:31:36.758 --> 00:31:39.100
I don't have muscae volitantes.

338
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.738
He told me that what you described simply doesn't exist.

339
00:31:44.738 --> 00:31:49.296
That's exactly why I'm scared.

340
00:31:49.296 --> 00:31:52.310
Why would you be scared of something that doesn't exist?

341
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.300
But it's right in front of my eyes.

342
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.248
It's right there.

343
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.350
Do you mean you are seeing a ghost, Professor Wang?

344
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.810
Li Yao.

345
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:15.830
What if I told you that aside from humanity, there exists another advanced civilization?

346
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.210
We'll call it the Farmer.

347
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:23.490
In the eyes of the Farmer, all humans are a bunch of turkeys on the farm.

348
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.410
I'm a turkey scientist.

349
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.686
And you're a turkey doctor.

350
00:32:27.686 --> 00:32:29.500
What would you think of that?

351
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:37.030
So the advanced civilization enjoys putting a countdown in your eyes, huh?

352
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.240
Is the end of the countdown the Thanksgiving Day of the advanced civilization?

353
00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.560
It's a very constructive viewpoint.

354
00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.392
But why is it only in my eyes? And you can't see it?

355
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.424
Who are you calling this late?

356
00:32:57.424 --> 00:32:59.752
A feeder on the farm.

357
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:03.450
Hello, Dr. Shen.

358
00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:04.640
I'm Wang Miao.

359
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.400
I would like to have a chat with you in person.

360

364

Our Superconductivity Research Center has one, too.

She's dealing with something in the study upstairs. That one. You can go look for her.

368
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.880
I talked to experts from various fields.

369
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.324
They all said it was impossible.

370

Like this one.

374
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:38.350
Professor Wang, how's the nanoscience project going under your leadership?

375
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.710
The nanoscience project?

376
00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.684
Is that relevant?

377
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.440
They are two completely different fields of knowledge.

378
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.380
Stop your research.

379
00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.420
What?

380
00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.320
What did you say?

381
00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.010
Stop?

382
00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:08.364
It is a major national project.

383
00:36:08.364 --> 00:36:12.356
Our research team has spent over a decade on it.

384
00:36:12.356 --> 00:36:15.880
If you're asking me to terminate it, you have to give me a reason right?

385
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.658
Just try it.

386
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.980
Tell me what you know.

387
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.500
This is all that I can tell you.

388
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.250
I can't.

389
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.710
It's not happening.

390
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.634
Try it.

391
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.824
You can't joke about this.

392
00:36:39.824 --> 00:36:44.860
Do you know that we are the one and only research team that does nano experiments in that area?

393
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:50.962
I know that we've hit a bottleneck at the moment.

394
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.440
I know we can't put it into mass production.

395
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.280
But even if we can't solve the problem, someone else will.

396
00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.190
But I won't give up.

397
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.538
I certainly hope that the problem can be solved under my leadership.

398
00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.580

399
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.512
see what happens if you stop it.
