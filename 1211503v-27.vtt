3
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.350
Is everything okay at work?

4
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.680
That's alright.

5
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.280
The teachers are mostly Father's
former students and co-workers.

6
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090
They are nice to me.

7
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.450
Your mother bears no responsibility
for your father's death.

8
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.030
Whereas your father

9
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.280
clung to his own faith

10
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.800
in a manner that was not healthy

11
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
and caused you
and your mother to suffer.

12
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.870
Is that why you and your daughter

13
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.090
never get along with your mother?

14
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.310
I don't oppose Yang Dong to see her.

15
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.900
But Yang Dong

16
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.580
seemed to understand it,

17
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.910
so she never mentioned

18
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.590
her grandmother in front of me.

19
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.280
Just now you said you were going to see
the Red Guard who killed your father.

20
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.950
What did you mean?
Did you want revenge?

21
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.630
I had no intention of revenge.

22
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.030
After all,

23
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.280
on that morning at the Red Coast Base,

24
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.840
(I had taken revenge on all of humanity,)

25
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.410
(including them.)

26
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.910
(I had already despaired
of human civilization.)

27
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.560
(Introducing a higher civilization
in the universe)

28
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.960
(to the human world)

29
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.370
(had finally become
my unwavering ideal.)

30
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.430
The Red Coast Base was dismantled.

31
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.840
How did you contact the ETO?

32
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.000
To be precise,

33
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.400
it wasn't me who contacted them,

34
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.860
but someone else did.

35
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.930
Who?

36
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.710
Half a year after I returned to university,

37
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.800
I received an important project

38
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.880
to design a large
radio astronomy observatory.

39
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.800
♪Not big♪

40
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.720
(For that,
I went out with my project team,)

41
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.860
(and we went to many places)

42
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.310
(to choose the site
for the observatory.)

43
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.480
(Finally, we chose a place with the best
electromagnetic environment,)

44
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.980
(which was a remote mountainous area
in the Northwest.)

45
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.870
You're all tired.

46
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.270
You've been walking all day.

47
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.300
Here you are, drink some water.

48
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.660
Come on, drink some water.

49
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.260
Thank you.

51
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.660
No.

52
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.020
You're tired.

53
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.240
You take so many instruments.

54
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.380
These things look very advanced.

55
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.620
They are all foreign words.

56
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.620
Professor Ye,
can you all speak foreign languages?

57
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.340
English?

58
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.380
What?

59
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.540
English?

60
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.500
I don't know.

61
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.980
It's a foreign language anyway.

62
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.620
If you guys can speak it,
I'll go and get Bethune down,

63
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.460
the team has something
to discuss with him.

64
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.320
Bethune?

65
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.000
We don't know how to call him,
so we call him that.

66
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.820
Does he treat you?

67
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.140
No.

68
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.280
He's been planting trees
on this back hill for almost three years.

69
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.320
Plant trees?

70
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.360
He says it's for finches,

71
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.040
the ones that are dying out.

72
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.610
Almost there.

73
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.160
We'll get there through these trees.

74
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.940
A foreigner came all the way to China

75
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.080
just to plant a tree.

76
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.160
Isn't there something wrong with him?

77
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.480
Or he has some kind of conspiracy.

78
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.640
Here we are, right here.

79
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.220
Bethune.

80
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.520
Hello.

81
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.220
Hello.

82
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.720
Bethune.

83
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.820
Hello.

84
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.660
Bethune.

85
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.040
Bethune.

86
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.920
(There)

87
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.000
(I saw him.)

88
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.940
Hi.

89
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.340
Nice to meet you.

90
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.000
I am Ye Wenjie.

91
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.640
Mike Evans.

92
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.340
Sorry I can't offer you anything to drink.

93
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.880
We're out of coffee a while ago.

94
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.770
There's water, but...

95
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.260
I only have one cup.

96
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.720
No problem.

97
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.320
Ask him what he's doing here.

98
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.600
He was asking what are you
really doing here.

99
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.800
Saving lives.

100
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.320
Save the local lives?

101
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.220
It's true.

102
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.980
The ecological conditions here are...

103
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.820
Why are you all like this?

104
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.520
Saving human lives
is the only noble act?

105
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.540
Or other species ain't significant?

106
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.180
Who gave humans
such a high honor anyway?

107
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.420
No.

108
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.500
Human beings do not need a savior.

109
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.420
They all live a life much

110
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.840
much better than they deserve.

111
00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.960
We heard you're trying
to save a type of bird.

112
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.210
Yes.

113
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.900
A swallow.

114
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.420
Specifically, a subspecies
of the Northwest Brown Swallow.

115
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.600
But it has a long scientific name.

116
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.640
It's a little long.
I won't bore you with it.

117
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.140
Every spring,
they follow ancient well-established

118
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.020
migration route themselves.

119
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.540
They nest only here.

120
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.060
But as the trees disappear
year after year,

121
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.960
they can no longer find a home.

122
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.860
When I first discovered the species，
they had less‍‍ than 10,000 left.

123
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.180
If the trend continues,
within five years, they'll be extinct.

124
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.340
Trees I've planted now provide a habitat
for some of them.

125
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.320
The population is rising.

126
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.220
I must plant more trees

127
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.480
and expand this Eden.

128
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.160
May I?

129
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.520
Thank you.

130
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.080
You'd even better see it for yourself.

131
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.460
I see it.

132
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.220
Not that pretty, right?

133
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.180
Of course, they're not
as crowd pleasing as pandas.

134
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.460
Every day on this planet,
some species that

135
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.970
don't draw the attention
of humans go extinct.

136
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.860
You planted all of these trees yourself?

137
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.860
Mostly.

138
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.280
Initially I hired some locals to help out,
but I soon ran out of money.

139
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.520
Saplings and irrigation
are very expensive here.

140
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.500
I can't understand it at all.

141
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.380
Tell him that
he is famous for planting trees here.

142
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.260
The county will reward him.

143
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.600
Tell him to come to the team tomorrow.

144
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.720
He said the government decided to
reward you for planting trees here.

145
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.540
Can they reward me with some hands

146
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.440
to help plant some trees?

147
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.720
What did he say?

148
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.020
He said...

149
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.100
Forget it.

150
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.780
Tell him that

151
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.620
I've informed him.

152
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.080
I have work in the field. I'm leaving.

153
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.280
Why are you not going with him?

154
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.680
Does this interest you?

155
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.460
Were you interested
in the brown swallow

156
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.380
or the man?

157
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:54.660
It's the reason

158
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.580
why he did these things.

159
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.580
Evans's father is the president
of a multinational oil company.

160
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.220
But he doesn't look like
a billionaire's child at all.

161
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.740
Evans told me something happened
when he was 12 years old.

162
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.300
It was the event

163
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.120
(that changed him forever.)

164
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.260
(Son,)

165
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.660
(do you know how the dinosaurs)

166
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.520
(became extinct in the Cretaceous?)

167
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.980
(Because the asteroid fell to the earth)

168
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.900
(and led the abrupt change
in global climate.)

169
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.300
(And do you know)

170
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.820
(the species on the earth now)

171
00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:01.880
(are going extinct even faster
and more frightening than in the Cretaceous?)

172
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:08.700
(And now is truly
the age of mass extinction.)

173
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:14.300
(This is only an insignificant episode
in the process of extinction.)

174
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:20.630
(We can survive without seabirds,
but we can not survive without oil.)

175
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.080
(Do you know what oil means to us?)

176
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.500
Your birthday present,
that beautiful Ferrari,

177
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.940
and that cruise ship over there,
without oil,

178
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.060
it's just a pile of scrap iron.

179
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.980
If you want to visit your grandfather,

180
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.420
you can get there on my private jet
and cross the ocean in a dozen hours or so.

181
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:54.980
But without oil, you'd have to tumble
in a sailboat for a month!

182
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.460
This is the rule of civilization.

183
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.620
The priority
is to ensure humans' survival

184
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.460
and their comfortable lifestyle.

185
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.030
Everything else
is secondary.

186
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.260
(In Evans's view,)

187
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.860
(all humans,)

188
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.560
(including his father, are executioners.)

189
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.100
(At that time,)

190
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.210
(I could understand him.)

191
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.900
He had high hopes for me,

192
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.080
and I just didn't
turn out the way he wanted.

193
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.680
After that day, it was like that the eyes
of those dying seabirds were

194
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.040
(staring.)

195
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.200
(That changed my life.)

196
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.780
When I was 13, my father asked me
what I wanted to do when I grow up.

197
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.900
I said

198
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.200
nothing.

199
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.000
I just want to save lives.

200
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.300
You have a big dream.

201
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.220
No.

202
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.460
I only want to save
an endangered species.

203
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.100
It could be
a bird that wasn't very pretty,

204
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.420
a dull butterfly, or a beetle

205
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.480
that no one would even notice.

206
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.220
Later, I studied biology
specialized in birds and insects.

207
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.520
In my eyes, saving
a species of birds and insects

208
00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.360
has no difference
from saving a human guy.

209
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:51.120
This is the basic program of
species egalitarianism.

210
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.360
(This was the first time I heard)

211
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.150
(the species egalitarianism.)

212
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.540
It is a doctrine founded
by Evans himself.

213
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.420
It can also be called a belief.

214
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.860
Its core idea is that

215
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.940
all living species on earth

216
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.640
are born equal.

217
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.380
A simple human being,

218
00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.180
a pure human being,
a person with self-awareness.

219
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.260
This is our evaluation of him
at that time.

220
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.300
In Evans's view,

221
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.220
human selfishness and hypocrisy

222
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.420
are the reasons for the delay

223
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.380
in achieving species egalitarianism.

224
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.580
Such a paranoid idealist.

225
00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.700
Yes.

226
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.680
As long as humans are alive,

227
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.700
this ideal cannot be realized.

228
00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.540
So you don't agree with him.

229
00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:09.500
But, I envy him.

230
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.580
(He let me know that in that age,)

231
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.920
(people)

232
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.500
(could still live like this.)

233
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.420
So you told him about the existence
of the Trisolaran Civilization?

234
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.200
No.

235
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.900
After that, we didn't see each other
for a long time.

236
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.700
The site there was not approved.

237
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.200
We soon returned to Beijing.

238
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.040
(One day three years later,)

239
00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.120
(I suddenly received a postcard
from Evans.)

240
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.460
(Postcard of Chinese People's Post)

241
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.260
(Come here,)

242
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.110
(and tell me how to live.)

243
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.340
(So I went back again)

244
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.400
(to that remote
mountain village in the Northwest.)

245
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.440
I won't stop.

246
00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.120
If I stop, I will be crazy.

247
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.820
I just walked in

248
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.400
and saw that the trees you planted
have grown very tall.

249
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.760
Are these really meaningful?

250
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.840
I just came back from abroad.

251
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.420
My dad.

252
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.640
My father

253
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.480
died two months ago.

254
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:54.140
He left me 4.5 billion dollars.
I mean inheritance.

255
00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.380
Not even including real estate.

256
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.980
My brother and sister
got 5 million each.

257
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.160
5 million.

258
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.440
It's not what I expected at all.

259
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.640
Maybe, he deeply thought highly of me.

260
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.720
Or

261
00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.840
my ideals.

262
00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:44.800
Isn't it a comforting thing
that he supports you?

263
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.690
I also learned another news abroad.

264
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.140
I used to spend a lot of time
around the world

265
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.720
planting trees
where deforestation rates were high.

266
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:03.320
But for the past two years,
those trees were cut down by more than...

267
00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.650
more than 70%.

268
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.840
Years of effort is to be destroyed.

269
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:17.280
There is no way that
I can beat their logging power.

270
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.500
Every country should have a forest law.

271
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.520
Maybe we should go to the government.

272
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.520
Someone will stop their
uncontrolled logging.

273
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.280
Ye,

274
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.720
do you really think
I'm doing it for a few trees?

275
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.360
I could easily ask them

276
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.310
to stop cutting trees
and plant some more with all my money.

277
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.620
I can make all the yellow soil
be planted with quick growth forests.

278
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.160
That's easy.

279
00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.520
But it's meaningless.

280
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.580
The local people,

281
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.780
everything they say here
is a result of poverty.

282
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.980
But I ask you.
Is it any different in the wealthy nations?

283
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.180
(They create their own environments,)

284
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.140
then simply shipped the heavy
polluting industries to the poor nations.

285
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.280
The whole human race
is essentially the same.

286
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.540
As long as civilization
continues to develop,

287
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.590
the brown swallow,
and all the other swallows in this world

288
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.930
sooner or later

289
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.200
go extinct.

290
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.980
It's just

291
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.760
a matter of time.

292
00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.680
Do you know why I came to China?

293
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.440
I believe and think that

294
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.180
the idea of species egalitarianism

295
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.400
emerged in the ancient East.

296
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.320
Do you mean Buddhism?

297
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.300
Yes.

298
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.780
See? The focus of Christianity is men.

299
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.300
Even though the other species
were given a place on Noah's ark,

300
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.900
they were never truly given
the same status as humans.

301
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.940
But Buddhism,

302
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.700
Buddhism,

303
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.520
it saves all lives.

304
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.900
So

305
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.840
I came to the East.

306
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.560
But now it turns out
it's the same everywhere.

307
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.360
Yes.

308
00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.970
I can understand you.

309
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.240
What can I do now?

310
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.980
Where are the pillars of my life?

311
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.980
I have 4.5 billion dollars
and an international oil company.

312
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.380
So what?

313
00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.540
Surly humans have invested

314
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.380
more than 45 billion
in saving endangered species.

315
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.120
(And probably more than 450 billion)

316
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.090
(is already spent in saving
environment for deterioration.)

317
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.940
(But what difference does it make?)

318
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.850
(Civilization continues on its path)

319
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.380
(to destruction of all lives on earth.)

320
00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.430
(4.5 billion dollars.)

321
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.660
That is not enough to build
an aircraft carrier.

322
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.300
But even if we build
1,000 aircraft carriers,

323
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.040
it's impossible to stop
the madness of man.

324
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.040
Maybe,

325
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.160
humans can no longer rely on
their own power to change.

326
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.720
But

327
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:14.240
are there other forces
outside of humans?

328
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.360
If God existed,

329
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.520
he would be dead already.

330
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.620
(Do not answer.)

331
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.120
(Do not answer.)

332
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.960

333
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.260
(Do not answer)

334
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.680
Yes,

335
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.680
there are other forces.

336
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.020
(Then I completely told him)

337
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:11.320
(about the Red Coast Base
and the Trisolaris.)

338
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.880
So many years have passed,

339
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.130
many details I thought...

340
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.040
I thought I had forgotten.

341
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.410
But in what I just told you,

342
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.320
it all came back to me.

343
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.680
I even remember

344
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.320
(the temperature of the sun
on my face that day.)

(Come here.)

(I will help you conquer this world.)

355
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.020
(Our civilization is no longer capable of
solving its own problems.)

356
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.440
(We need your force to intervene.)

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.360
I can't believe what you said.

360
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.960
After all, it's too

361
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.720
amazing.

362
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.160
I understand.

363
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.080
Luckily,

364
00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.000
I have the power to confirm it all.

365
00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.640
If what you said is true,

366
00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.480
then we are comrades.

367
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.260
After that,

368
00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.540
he disappeared for three years

369
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.100
without any news.

370
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.700
I didn't know
if he was really somewhere in the world

371
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.860
to confirm what I had told him,

372
00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.440
or how he would confirm it.

373
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.260
One winter three years later,

374
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.920
(I suddenly received an invitation)

375
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.980
(from an unknown university
in Western Europe)

376
00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.440
(to be a visiting scholar for six months.)

377
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.180
(After arriving at the airport,)

378
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.980
(a young man came to pick me up.)

379
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.620
(But he didn't take me
out of the airport,)

380
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.920
(but returned to the tarmac.)

381
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.040
(We boarded a helicopter together.)

382
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.280
(The young man told me that)

383
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.700
(the place we were going to)

384
00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.720
(was the Second Red Coast Base.)

385
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.740
According to the location and frequency
you gave me,

386
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.940
we received a message from Trisolaran.

387
00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:22.040
Everything you said
has been confirmed.

388
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.540
(The great Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet
has set sail,)

389
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.540
(targeting the solar system,)

390
00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:33.000
and will arrive in 450 years.

391
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.740
What you see now
are the first members of the ETO.

392
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.660
Our ideal is to invite
the Trisolaran Civilization

393
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.820
(to transform human civilization
to curb the madness and evil of human.)

394
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:53.500
(And make this earth a harmonious,
prosperous)

395
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.640
(and sinless world again.)

396
00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.700
More and more people
agree with our ideals.

397
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.380
Our organization
is expanding dramatically.

398
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.640
We have members all over the world.

399
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.440
What I can do?

400
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.940
You will be the Supreme Commander
of the Earth-Trisolaris Movement.

401
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:26.080
All the warriors of the ETO
recognize your qualifications.

402
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.460
Eliminate human tyranny!

403
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.260
World belongs to Trisolaris!

404
00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.900
Eliminate human tyranny!

405
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.640
World belongs to Trisolaris!

406
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.220
Eliminate human tyranny!

407
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:57.080
World belongs to Trisolaris!

408
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:24.140
About the process of the establishment
of the ETO,

409
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.140
this is all I know.

410
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.500
And

411
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.420
the Redemptionists, the Adventists,
the Survivors and their struggle,

412
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:42.200
you have already known them
in the previous ETO conference.

413
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:48.230
Do you think the ETO
will deteriorate in the future?

414
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.720
It's just a feeling.

415
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.460
(But at that time,)

416
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.200
(I was unable to make any judgment
beyond the historical perspective.)

417
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.180
If you couldn't judge,
why did you volunteer to join,

418
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.620
and to become their commander?

419
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.340
Did you want to change them?

420
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.260
It turned out

421
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.380
I couldn't.

422
00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.520
There was little I could do.

423
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.340
(I thought I could lead the spirit)

424
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.170
(and make up for mistakes.)

425
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:33.400
(Then I just understood one thing.)

426
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.180
(A quote from Mike Evans)

427
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.130
(has become the motto of the Adventists.)

428
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:47.340
We don't know what the
extraterrestrial intelligence looks like,

429
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.780
but know humans.

430
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.820
How do you think?

431
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:58.340
I admit
I had expectations of the Trisolaran.

432
00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.980
At the ETO conference,

433
00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.940
you mentioned that messages
sent from the Trisolaris to Earth

434
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.500
were intercepted by the Adventists.

435
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.500
What was the content of that?

436
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.340
I don't know.

437
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.140
They are very well organized.

438
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.020
All I know is that
they intercepted the messages.

439
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.100
After the Adventists monopolized
communications with the Trisolaran,

440
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.420
did you set up
the Third Red Coast Base?

441
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.580
I had the plan.

442
00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.940
But only finished the receiving part.

443
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.180
(Then the construction stopped.)

444
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.820
(And the equipment and the base
were dismantled.)

445
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.460
(Why?)

446
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.460
(Because there were no more messages)

447
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.260
(coming from the direction
of Alpha Centauri,)

448
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.530
(not on all bands.)

449
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.460
I think you have also confirmed this.

450
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:58.140
According to what you said,
it means that at least four years ago,

451
00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:03.340
Trisolaris had lost contact with the Earth,
right?

452
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.780
No.

453
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.740
I guessed they changed to another way
to communicate.

454
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:14.340
And Evans didn't deny it.

455
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.260
Did you change the way
you receive and transmit,

456
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.140
or did you just make it up all the time?

457
00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.340
The Lord will come.

458
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.340
Am I qualified to make up?

459
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.540
The Lord has known the entire history
of human civilization.

460
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.500
Don't ask me how I did it.

461
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.560
It is beyond our knowledge.

462
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.300
Can I understand it this way?

463
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.920
That Evans cheated you.

464
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:56.740
It should be said that
he never confided to me

465
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.820
his true innermost thoughts,

466
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.940
(but only expressed)

467
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.100
(his own sense of mission
to other species on the Earth.)

468
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.780
(I didn't expect that
his hatred for humanity)

469
00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.420
(generated by this sense of mission,)

470
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.620
(had reached such an extreme level that)

471
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.340
he regarded the destruction
of human civilization

472
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:28.000
as his ultimate ideal.

473
00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.160
It can be said that this Evans has taken
advantage of Trisolaran Civilization.

474
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.720
It's not just Evans.

475
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:46.220
(The Adventists want to use
the power of the aliens)

476
00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.700
(to destroy humanity.)

477
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:55.410
(And the Redemptionists
worship the aliens as the God.)

478
00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.340
(But the Survivors
belong to the group of people)

479
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.960
(who betrayed their compatriots to live.)

480
00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:09.460
So all of this
is completely inconsistent

481
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:14.760
with your ideal of using Extraterrestrial Intelligence
to transform human beings.

482
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.920
I lit the fire,

483
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.900
but I couldn't control it.

484
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.270
I thought high civilization meant

485
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.060
the existence of a high morality
that could save the earth.

486
00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.220
But unlike you,
Evans wants to destroy humanity.

487
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.980
Is that why
you want to destroy the Adventists?

488
00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.380
Have you ever thought that
a man like Evans

489
00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.740
would take another way
to destroy mankind,

490
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:49.240
even if without the clue you provided
about the Extraterrestrial Intelligence?

491
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.500
Maybe.

492
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:57.900
With a plan to destroy the Adventists,
why not just attack the Judgment Day?

493
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:01.980
Besides, the Redemptionists' forces
are loyal to you.

494
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.260
You have the power and the ability
to destroy it,

495
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.560
and even take it over.

496
00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.220
Lord's messages are stored

497
00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:17.640
on one of the Judgment Day's computers.

498
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.660
(If that ship is attacked,)

499
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.740
(the Adventists
will destroy it in the moment of crisis.)

500
00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.900
(Those messages are too important
for us to lose,)

501
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.980
(just as Christianity
can't lose the Bible,)

502
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.800
(and Islam can't lose the Koran.)

503
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.340
I think you will face the same problem.

504
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.220
The Adventists
holds the Lord's message hostage.

505
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.040
We can't do anything
about the Judgment Day.

506
00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.860
So what would you like to tell us?

507
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.080
What would you like to suggest?

508
00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.620
Nothing.

509
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.900
You refer to the Trisolaris as the Lord,

510
00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.020
does it mean that
you've developed a religious attachment

511
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.380
to it like the Redemptionists?

512
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:22.170
Or maybe you've
converted to Trisolarism?

513
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.180
It's just a habit.

514
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:30.180
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

515
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.380
Did the Trisolaris teach the Adventists
some technologies that

516
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.380
above the current level
of human science?

517
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.090
Unlikely.

518
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:45.840
Because these technologies
are likely to fall into your hands.

519
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.660
The last but also
the most important question.

520
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.100
So far, the Trisolaris

521
00:41:54.100 --> 00:42:00.920
has only sent radio waves
to the Earth?
