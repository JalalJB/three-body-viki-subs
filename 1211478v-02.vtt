2
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.920
Youâ€¦

3
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.310
How long have you been married?

4
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.000
Eight years now.

5
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.210
How old is your child?

6
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.830
Seven.

7
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.350
I bought this house in preparation for marriage.

8
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.120
I thought she'd actually start a family with me.

9
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.892
Yang Dong.

10
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.620
She was like a star in the sky, which was far, far away from you.

11
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.220
Even the light it shed on you felt cold.

12
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.192
This afternoon, after you left,

13
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.910
people from the Battle Command Center talked to me in private.

14
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.830
They wanted me to join the Frontiers of Science.

15
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.430
Well, you didn't agree, right?

16
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.900
No.

17
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.130
Right!

18
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.630
Your choice's quite right!

19
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.870
Let me tell you something. They're just a bunch of arrogant idiots!

20
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040
They seem to have done some digging.

21
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.094
Yes. Worldwide digging.

22
00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:52.420
So they should know that there are two people that have nothing to do with the Frontiers of Science at all.

23
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.770
And Yang Dong... was one of them.

24
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.300
<i>[Three-Body]</i>

25
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.360
<i>[Episode 2]</i>

26
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.700
Dr. Ding,

27
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.527
why did Yang Dong make a choice like that?

28
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.529
Because physics doesn't exist anymore.

29
00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.150
If physics didn't exist anymore,

30
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.950
and you release your hold right now, this book would fly into the sky instead of falling to the floor.

31
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.300
You're right.

32
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.690
If physics didn't exist anymore, Schrodinger wouldn't have been on the floor.

33
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.950
He would've beenâ€¦ in the sky.

34
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.750
So, Einstein wouldn't have been on the floor either.

35
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.250
Newton wouldn't have been on the floor either.

36
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.000
None of these people would've been on the floor.

37
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.620
They would've all been floating in the sky.

38
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.110
They're all on the floor now.

39
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.060
Do you know how to play this?

40
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.890
A little.

41
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.664
Yang Dong and I loved it

42
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.072
because it reminded us of the collision in a particle collider.

43
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.710
Help me clean this.

44
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.430
You may toss them wherever you want. It's okay.

45
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.290
No need. It's okay. You don't have to stack them up.

46
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.578
Just toss them away.

47
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.210
Can you hit it into the hole?

48
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.470
I think any normal person can do it.

49
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.968
Let's rotate it 90 degrees.

50
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.800
All right.

51
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.740
Okay. This will do.

52
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.320
Dr. Ding, what are we doing?

53
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.060
Do it again.

54
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.750
Okay, now the experiments are over. Let's analyze the results.

55
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.040
We conducted five collision experiments in total, right?

56
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.570
The first four took place in different positions at different times,

57
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.780
and the fifth one happened in the same position as the first one, but at a different time,

58
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.010
so you're not surprised by this outcome, right?

59
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.630
All five collision experiments generated the same result.

60
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.450
What do you mean?

61
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:22.596
Iâ€¦ I'd like you to explain this outcome with the language of physics.

62
00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:24.874
Language of physics.

63
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:38.150
In the five previous experiments, there was no change whatsoever in the mass of the two balls.

64
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.960
Their relative positions, if using the pool table as a reference frame, never changed either.

65
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.230
The velocity vector at which the white ball hit the black one hardly changed,

66
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.370
which caused the momentum exchange generated by the collision between the balls to remain unchanged as well.

67
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.700
That's the reason the black ball went into the hole every time it got hit.

68
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.078
So now you've discovered a great law.

69
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.869
the laws of physics are even in terms of time and space.

70
00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:04.650
From the start of human history until now, all the discoveries made in the field of physics,

71
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.460
such as Archimedes' principle, the string theory, every single one of those things is based on this law.

72
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.200
You know what I mean?

73
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.400
I understand your words, but I don't know what you're trying to convey.

74
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.228
Do you dare to imagine...

75
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.624
another result?

76
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.722
<i>In the first experiment, the black ball was hit into the hole.</i>

77
00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:34.408
<i>In the second one, well, the black ball went off track.</i>

78
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.804
<i>In the third one, the black ball flew into mid-air.</i>

79
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.110
<i>In the fourth one, the black ball, like a scared sparrow, flew around in the room.</i>

80
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.030
<i>And then in the fifth one, at nearly the speed of light, it flew off this table,</i>

81
00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.620
<i>penetrated through the wall, broke free from Earth's gravity, and shot straight out of the solar system.</i>

82
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.440
<i>Just like what Asimov depicts in his sci-fi novels.</i>

83
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.328
If the results of the experiments were like that,

84
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.650
whatâ€¦ what would you think?

85
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.390
You and Yang Dong both liked playing pool...

86
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.766
because it reminded you of the collision in a particle collider.

87
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.400
<i>So this kind of thing really did happen?</i>

88
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.598
In Yang Dong's lab?

89
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.930
<i>The first data, recorded at 9:07.</i>

90
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.796
<i>The second data, recorded at 10:22.</i>

91
00:10:59.796 --> 00:11:01.790
<i>The third data, recorded at 10:50.</i>

92
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.990
<i>They're all inconsistent.</i>

93
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.960
<i>They're also inconsistent with the calculation results.</i>

94
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.180
<i>The experiment failed.</i>

95
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.440
It happened.

96
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.240
But that was always part of the experiment.

97
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.000
<i>In terms of experiment, that was quite normal.</i>

98
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.140
<i>Yeah. In terms of experiments, abnormal data is a normal thing, right?</i>

99
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.220
<i>But this time, things are different.</i>

100
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.790
<i>Let's get back to pool.</i>

101
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.630
<i>So, if in the fourth experiment, the black ball flew all around like a sparrow,</i>

102
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.111
<i>and in the fifth one it flew out of the solar system,</i>

103
00:11:29.111 --> 00:11:34.140
<i>if I need you to verify that kind of results, would you be able to do it with deduction?</i>

104
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.040
I specialize in applied physics, so I don't know much about this kind of stuff,

105
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.990
but I think that's very unlikely.

106
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.170
<i>These are the faxes you sent to the victim.</i>

107
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.718
<i>You sent all these?</i>

108
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.070
<i>What's wrong?</i>

109
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.200
<i>Is your girlfriend okay?</i>

110
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.040
<i>What's going on exactly?</i>

111
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.960
<i>What's the matter?</i>

112
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.390
<i>Look at this.</i>

113
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.390
<i>Experiment results.</i>

114
00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.790
<i>No. The time. 
[ Sunday, August 02, 2006; 09:00:00 ]</i>

115
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.080
<i>The time. 
[ Sunday, August 02, 2006; 09:50:53 ]</i>

116
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.220
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

117
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.060
<i>Nine o'clock... Nine o'clock.</i>

118
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.360
<i>It couldn't have been nine.</i>

119
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.260
<i>Impossible.</i>

120
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.840
<i>The data, which was the same as Yang Dong's,</i>

121
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.260
<i>had been delivered to Professor Munphy while her experiment was still ongoing.</i>

122
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.120
No way.

123
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.650
According to our known knowledge of physics, that's absolutely impossible.

124
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:38.440
We think it's impossible because right now we still believe in physics.

125
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.650
Yang Dong expounded and proved it.

126
00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.378
I don't know either.

127
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.720
I want to find out as well.

128
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.960
If this is true, thenâ€¦ the evenness of time and space

129
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.876
that laws of physics are based on will be

130
00:12:54.876 --> 00:12:57.790
non-existent, which meansâ€¦

131
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.620
Which means physics doesn't exist anymore.

132
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.440
This will be a catastrophe for the research of cutting-edge theory.

133
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:17.150
So, to make an achievement in theoretical physics, you need an unswerving religious belief.

134
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.330
That's why there are people believing the hypothesis about the shooter and the farmer.

135
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.550
The shooter and the farmer.

136
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.150
That's the theory of the Frontiers of Science.

137
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.080
Yeah. Anyway, those theories which cannot be proved right

138
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.970
and cannot be proved wrong either are actually, to put it bluntlyâ€¦

139
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.780
You know, they give people hope.

140
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.224
But sometimes this kind of hope might drive people

141
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.506
to their doom.

142
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.194
<i>I always felt that</i>

143
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.950
I was about to win her heart.

144
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.079
<i>Maybe, if you accept my proposal, the experiment will go well.</i>

145
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.500
<i>The experiment failed.</i>

146
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.210
<i>Then do some extra ones.</i>

147
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.110
But maybe I was wrong.

148
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.340
<i>The data, which was the same as Yang Dong's,</i>

149
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.830
<i>had been delivered to Professor Murphy when her experiment was still ongoing.</i>

150
00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.740
<i>No way.</i>

151
00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.810
<i>According to our known knowledge of physics, that's absolutely impossible.</i>

152
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.100
<i>We think it's impossible, because right now we still believe in physics.</i>

153
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.290
<i>Physics</i>

154
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.140
<i>doesn't exist anymore.</i>

155
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.790
<i>Physics doesn't exist anymore.</i>

156
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.120
Are you blind?

157
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.920
What a psycho!

Hi.

170
00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.198
Welcome back to the Frontiers of Science.

171
00:17:36.198 --> 00:17:37.480
Sorry to disturb you.

172
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.590
No.

173
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.882
I'm very happy you called.

174
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.100
You want me to join the Frontiers of Science?

175
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.292
I want everybody to join us, and get to know us.

176
00:17:53.510 --> 00:18:00.250
I still can't fully accept your theory... though it sounds fascinating.

177
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:07.099
Anything, when you begin to doubt it and want to break through it, becomes the most fascinating.

178
00:18:07.099 --> 00:18:09.680
That's why our organization is named Frontiers of Science.

179
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.780
In this area, owning such a large manor house, the owner must be no ordinary person.

180
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.070
This is a private residence of one of our members.

181
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.358
It was offered to us for communication.

182
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.700
<i>Professor Wang?</i>

183
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.170
<i>Professor Wang?</i>

184
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.350
That member specializes in quantum entanglement, right?

185
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.150
Yes, it is.

186
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.940
<i>Welcome, friends visiting the Frontiers of Science for the first time.</i>

187
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.474
And welcome back, Professor Wang Miao.

188
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.830
Professor Wang participated in some of our previous discussions.

189
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:31.540
So, next, I'd like you to tell everybody what our research is about. 
<i> [Frontiers of Science]</i>

190
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.196
I think it's the shooter hypothesis and the farmer hypothesis.

191
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:43.050
<i>Assuming that a marksman leaves bullet holes on a target at intervals of 10 centimeters,</i>

192
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:48.400
<i>then suppose that on this target resides a kind of two-dimensional intelligent species.</i>

193
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:59.010
<i>Their scientists, after observing their universe, discovered a great law.</i>

194
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.980
<i>Each time they travel 10 centimeters, they're guaranteed to find a hole.<i></i></i>

195
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:16.710
<i>They mistake what the shooter did on a whim as an unchanging law of their universe.</i>

196
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.550
In the eyes of those two-dimensional creatures,

197
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.930
the holes made at intervals of 10 centimeters might be the greatest wonder in their world.

198
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.300
Maybe they're planning on adventuring.

199
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.820
Maybe they're even researching surveying equipment,

200
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:37.640
trying to find out which material can help them explore in a more efficient and safer way.

201
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.840
Maybe it's nano-material.

202
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.300
There's also a farmer hypothesis.

203
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.846
<i>There is a flock of turkeys on a farm.</i>

204
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.362
<i>Every day the farmer feeds them at 11 AM.</i>

205
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.789
<i>One of the turkeys, a scientist, observes the phenomenon.</i>

206
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.942
<i>It observes for almost a year, and there haven't been any exceptions,</i>

207
00:21:03.942 --> 00:21:09.069
<i>so it also announces a great law of their universe.</i>

208
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.714
<i>Food arrives at 11 AM every day.</i>

209
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.012
<i>One day, when it's 11 o'clock, the farmer shows up again,</i>

210
00:21:19.012 --> 00:21:22.558
<i>but it's Thanksgiving Day.</i>

211
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.596
<i>Food doesn't come.</i>

212
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.400
<i>The farmer walks inside,</i>

213
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.450
takes them all and slaughters them.

214
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.016
We might be like the two-dimensional scientist on that target...

215
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.420
<i>or the turkey scientist on the farm.</i>

216
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.199
If, in this world, there is indeed a kind of supernatural power,

217
00:21:54.199 --> 00:21:55.600
the shooter,

218
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.550
<i>then the regularity that the shooter knows is the truth.</i>

219
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.680
<i>Newton's classical mechanics is totally useless in the micro-world,</i>

220
00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.450
and Einstein's theory of relativity, when applied to the quantum world, raises even more problems.

221
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.536
If science has frontiers,

222
00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:16.479
<i>then what we're about to touch is very likely to be the frontiers.</i>

223
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.590
The "truth" that those two-dimensional creatures find is not the truth,

224
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.030
because in their world, they can never find the truth.

225
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.090
<i>Their science...</i>

226
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.210
has frontiers.

227
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.210
Then what's beyond the frontiers?

228
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.260
What regularities do the shooter and the farmer know?

229
00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.688
Personally, this is not just science.

230
00:22:39.688 --> 00:22:42.108
<i>It's more like a ritual.</i>

231
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.790
A ritual of infinite exploration of the frontiers of science.

232
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.790
But what's the point of all this?

233
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.350
State your opinions.

234
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.962
I have no impressive opinions.

235
00:22:53.962 --> 00:22:57.709
Every one of you know more about theories than I do,

236
00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:03.874
but I think today's discussion serves only to make scientists vulnerable.

237
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.350
In my eyes,

238
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
there's no way whatsoever to authenticate these hypotheses.

239
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.960
But if those two-dimensional creatures and the turkeys on the farm

240
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.400
<i>find out everything but are powerless to make any difference,</i>

241
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.160
<i>how despairing will they be?</i>

242
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.280
Actually, your current attitude proves that

243
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.550
no matter whether you're willing to admit it or not,

244
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.030
you've come to believe this hypothesis.

245
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.690
Even if I believe it, I will not accept that I'm a turkey scientist.

246
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:36.840
Previous to this, maybe you've never thought that you might be a turkey scientist.

247
00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.020
I will not accept I'm a turkey scientist.

248
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.458
Dr. Shen,

249
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.280
has it ever occurred to you

250
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.082
that such a statement can kill?

251
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.154
The turkeys on the farm

252
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.562
are meant to die on Thanksgiving Day.

253
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:27.416
<i> [Defend Our Mother Country]</i>

254
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.810
Professor Wang, you don't look very well.

255
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.790
Rough night?

256
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.334
The other day, you said those words to me on purpose, right?

257
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.100
What words?

258
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:02.210
Asking me to talk to Ding Yi.

259
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.590
Making me become suspicious of the Frontiers of Science.

260
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.350
All those were tricks meant for me, right?

261
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.750
You set a trap for me and waited for me to step into it.

262
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.914
Although you're a science guy, you're pretty smart.

263
00:25:12.914 --> 00:25:14.240
Well, what did you find out?

264
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.140
Fill me in.

265
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.880
Was Yang Dong's death really suicide?

266
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.880
In terms of criminology and forensic examination,

267
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:28.610
it was undoubtedly suicide, but if all their deaths were suicide, then what's the point of our investigation?

268
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.280
You're still trying to trick me.

269
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.920
You're trying to trick me into focusing on Yang Dong.

270
00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.920
That's right. I need to set another trap for you.

271
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.520
Yang Dong's funeral is in two days.

272
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.840
Go ahead. Go ahead.

273
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.190
Go ahead.

274
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.820
What are you doing?

275
00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.240
Give me a ride downhill.

276
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.620
That's not even my car. Why are you pulling?

277
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.006
People are prone to make mistakes whenâ€¦ when agitated.

278
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:29.062
He went to Ding Yi, and then Shen Yufei.

279
00:26:29.062 --> 00:26:30.590
Don't get too excited.

280
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.540
What's that going to prove?

281
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.549
I bet he'll attend Yang Dong's funeral.

282
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:37.850
Why?

283
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.580
No particular reason.

284
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.790
This Wang Miao guy strikes me as very special.

285
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:51.120
Old Chang, it's been such a long time, and this is just a case about scientists' suicides.

286
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.590
With such a large Battle Command Center, have you really found nothing?

287
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.700
It's about time you fill me in.

288
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.150
I mean, it's been some time since you transferred me here.

289
00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.438
Does everything going on in this center need to be reported to you?

290
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:08.446
All you have to do is solve the case of the scientist.

291
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.400
All right.

292
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.120
Consider it done.

293
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.360
I'll crack this case for you following the clues from Wang Miao.

294
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:21.536
But... don't forget our deal.

295
00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:25.364
My suspension, you need to handle it for me.

296
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.020
Have I not handled it for you?

297
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.330
Are you under suspension?

298
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.430
You're doing pretty well in my department, aren't you?

299
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.210
The first bow.

300
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.218
The second bow.

301
00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.994
The third bow.

302
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.454
Kin's reciprocal bow.

303
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.100
Ms. Ye, sorry for your loss.

304
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.238
Who are you?

305
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.530
I'm Yang Dong's friend.

306
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.870
My name is Wang Miao.

307
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.590
Thank you.

308
00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.616
Do you specialize in string theory as well?

309
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.670
No.

310
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.580
I specialize in nanotechnology.

311
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.280
Applied physics.

312
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:04.526
A few days ago, I read a news report, and it's about nanotechnology.

313
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:10.898
It mentioned a kind of super-strength nanomaterial.

314
00:29:10.898 --> 00:29:12.830
Its name is Flying Blade.

315
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:17.532
That's the very thing we've been researching in our lab.

316
00:29:17.532 --> 00:29:22.100
That's very audacious and very forward-looking.

317
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.450
You flatter us, Ms. Ye.

318
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.720
It happened not that long ago

319
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.750
when the superstring model verification experiment was conducted in Liangxiang,

320
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.920
I took a picture of Yang Dong.

321
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.040
I brought it here so you could have it as a keepsake.

322
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.158
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

323
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.640
There was a technical glitch when I was developing and printing it.

324
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.190
I'll develop and print another one and deliver it to your house in a few days.

325
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.844
Thank you.

326
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.418
You're welcome.

327
00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:04.630
See you, Ms. Ye.

328
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.680
You look pretty good dressed entirely in black.

329
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.550
I know what you're going to say.

330
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.600
I came here purely to show my respect for a scientist and offer my condolences.

331
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.690
Did I make myself clear enough?

332
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.020
Stop following me.

333
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.240
Did I ask you to make yourself clear?

334
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.712
You and Ye Wenjie, Yang Dong's mother, talked for a long time.

335
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.070
Is that so?

336
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.120
Sorry for your loss. Goodbye.

337
00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.150
It took you that long to say those words?

338
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.672
What is this?

339
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.450
- Hello? 
<i> - Xiao Wang?</i>

340

<i>- What's up?</i>

341
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.380
What's going on? I asked you to develop that roll of film for me.

342
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.340
Was there something wrong with your machine?

343
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.450
Why are there time codes on the pictures?

344
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.060
<i> That'sâ€¦ That's impossible.</i>

345
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.744
<i>That never happened to my other customers.</i>

346
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:53.440
<i>Could it be that your negative's problematic?</i>

347
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.040
Hold on.

348
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.000
The negative has it too.

349
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.920
Could it be the film?

350
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.110
- I bought the film from you as well. 
 <i> - It can't be.</i>

351
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.640
<i> I think it's your camera.</i>

352
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.500
<i>Could it be that you got the timer wrong?</i>

353
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.210
<i>Wait, what's the brand of your camera?</i>

354
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.760
Leica. M2, 1988.

355
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.800
Fully mechanical and manual.

356
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.410
<i>Well, that's a beautiful thing!</i>

357
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.130
<i>You're such a big spender!</i>

358
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.650
<i>It can't be. Your camera should have no timer in it.</i>

359
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:34.811
Well, even if it had a timer, there's no way the time could've appeared in the middle of the picture.

360
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:36.410
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

361
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.870
<i>How about you do some more research?</i>

362
00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.700
Something's not right.

363
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.670
- The color of these codes changes with the background. 
 <i> - What?</i>

364
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.680
Well, I'll do some research about it. Talk to you later.

365
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.080
<i> All right.</i>

366
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.940
Time?

367
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.940
They're all smaller than 60.

368
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.710
It's time.

369
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:53.290
Countdown.

370
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.092
It's a countdown.

371
00:34:57.092 --> 00:34:58.900

The data is identical, so they definitely got the time wrong.

I only sent him faxes.

If it was he who photocopied them, how could the faxes have been photocopied at different times?

396
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:24.440
Nobody could've gotten the results of your experiment before you conducted it.

397
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.080
It's definitely the machine. Have some faith in science, okay?

398
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.610
Can a photocopier make mistakes with only the time?
