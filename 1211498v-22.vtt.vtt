9
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.190
Last night, some branches
of our organization in Europe

10
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.510
were purged by the Battle Command Center.

11
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.240
All of them were the Redemptionists.

12
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.210
Not a member
of the Adventists was purged.

13
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.030
It was led by the Battle Command Center,

14
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.190
but I doubt
Pan Han and his men were behind it.

15
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.350
They must have had something to do
with Shen Yufei's death.

16
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.460
Commander.

17
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.740
Please don't go.

18
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.310
If you attend Shen Yufei's funeral,

19
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.910
the Battle Command Center
will target you,

20
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.180
and the Adventists
will question your stance.

21
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.130
I want to bid farewell to Shen Yufei.

22
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.690
If you knew what happened last night,

23
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.840
you'd be even more desperate.

24
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.630
I had moments of despair, but now

25
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.580
I pinned my hope on unknown kindness.

26
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.340
Kindness.

27
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:24.120
At the scale of the universe,
kindness is small, like dust.

28
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.370
Only when you understand these things

29
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.740
will you give up all hope.

30
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.660
Buddha bless you.

31
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.540
What are you thinking about?

32
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.270
Shen Yufei.

33
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.800
She worked to
solve the Three-Body Problem,

34
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.630
but in the end,
she realized there was no answer.

35
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.740
She sank into despair.

36
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.240
She was going to renovate
the dilapidated house for Trisolarans,

37
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.750
but only to realize
after all these years that

38
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.310
they planned to invade her planet.

39
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.720
It seems like Shen Yufei was not bad.

40
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.750
In the Three-Body players' meet-up,

41
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.510
Pan Han was always preaching
about the coming of Lord.

42
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.870
He never mentioned
how to solve the Three-Body Problem.

43
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.240
So, within the ETO, they hold
different opinions about the Lord.

44
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.870
Yeah.

45
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.500
We should have turned Shen Yufei.

46
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.220
Well, last night, many ETOs
were purged around the world.

47
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.800
Let's go.

48
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.390
Where are you going?

49
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.920
Get back to the game.

50
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.950
After being admitted as their comrade,

51
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.720
I want to see if the game
will enter a new process.

52
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.660
That's right.
Ask them to open a private server.

53
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.270
According to the decoded files,
it's a repair diary

54
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.920
from the Three-Body games from which
we managed to trace their source.

55
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.190
Attack it.

56
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.510
Which sect are other servers located in?

57
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.750
According to the position,
momentarily Europe.

58
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.190
Momentarily?

59
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.000
The server isn't actually
located on earth,

60
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.240
but is orbiting
on an artificial satellite

61
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.010
24,000 kilometers in space.

62
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.950
Contact the Space Department now.

63
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.770
Contact NASA now.

64
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.980
(Log on Three-Body game Yes No)

65
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.070
(Game manager interface is opened.)

66
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.010
(Are you sure to close the game?)

67
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.920
(Attention.)

68
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.390
(Server of Three-Body will be closed.)

69
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.430
(Free login for the rest of the time.)

70
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.980
(Three-Body will take you
to the last scene.)

71
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.510
Great Copernicus,
why have you come so late?

72
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.830
What's going on?

73
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.310
Why is everything gone?

74
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.630
The pyramid is gone.

75
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.670
The United Nations Headquarters is gone.
Even the huge Pendulum Monument is gone.

76
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.940
Don't feel so bad.

77
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.650
We will have more buildings.

78
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.510
What's that?

79
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.390
Stone?

80
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.120
That's your delusion.

81
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.270
It's people.
Hundreds of millions of people.

82
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.870
Almost everyone
in the Three-Body world is here.

83
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.600
What are they doing here?

84
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.990
Waiting for the expedition.

85
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.360
Three cycles of civilizations
have passed,

86
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.740
and you've missed many great enterprises.

87
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.960
What are these?

88
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.200
Are they stars?

89
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.240
They are greater than stars.

90
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.390
I have never seen such a formation.

91
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.000
More than 30 stars along each edge
of the formation.

92
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.030
A total of more than a thousand stars.

93
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.510
They look less like stars
and more like artificial formation.

94
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.480
The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet.

95
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.750
It's about to begin its expedition.

96
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.750
Trisolaran civilization has already achieved
the capacity for interstellar flight?

97
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.080
Yes.

98
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.150
All those magnificent ships
can reach one-tenth the speed of light.

99
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.910
One-tenth the speed of light?

100
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.000
That is a great accomplishment,
as far as I understand it,

101
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.910
but it still seems too slow
for interstellar flight.

102
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.200
The journey of a thousand miles
begins with the first step.

103
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.790
The key is finding the right destination.

104
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.080
What's the fleet's destination?

105
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.870
A star with planets
about four light-years away.

106
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.510
That's the closest star
to the Trisolaran system.

107
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.600
Four light-years?

108
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.200
The closest star to us is also
about four light-years away.

109
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.440
You?

110
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.390
The Earth.

111
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.960
That's not very surprising.

112
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.840
In most regions of the Milky Way,
the distribution of stars is fairly even.

113
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.750
It's the result of star clusters
acting under the influence of gravity.

114
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:14.500
The distance between most stars is
between three and six light-years.

115
00:10:22.000 --> 00:11:04.860
Three-Body! Three-Body! Three-Body!

116
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:19.170
We captured the satellite as soon as possible
and began our investigations.

117
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.200
Execute signal search command
of satellite position.

118
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.150
What's going on
in the North American Combat Zone?

119
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.870
Help the satellite... Number 5811.

120
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.030
Members of the ETO have been controlled.

121
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.410
The email has been cc'ed.

122
00:11:38.440 --> 00:12:10.960
Three-Body! Three-Body! Three-Body!

123
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.080
People are not willing to leave.

124
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.080
That's their hope.

125
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.080
We wouldn't know the outcome
of the launch in our lifetimes,

126
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.030
but four or five hundred years from now,

127
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.080
our descendants will receive the news
from a new world.

128
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.890
That'll be the beginning of a new life
for the Trisolaran Civilization.

129
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.670
(The Trisolaran Expedition
to the new world has begun.)

130
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.030
(The fleet is still in flight.)

131
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.960
(Three-Body is over.)

132
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.630
(When you have returned
to the real world, )

133
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.510
(if you remain true
to the promise you've made, )

134
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.910
(please attend the meet-up
of the Earth-Trisolaris Organization.)

135
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.050
(The address will be
in the follow-up e-mail you receive.)

136
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.910
We've managed to block all the signals
to and from the satellite.

137
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.980
The Three-Body game has been shut down.

138
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.240
The Trisolaran Expedition
to the new world has begun.

139
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.860
The fleet is still in flight.

140
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.340
Their destination is the Earth.

141
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:33.220
In theory, many satellites
are four light-years away.

142
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.870
But if their destination is not the Earth,
are they doing all this?

143
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.840
The interrogation of the ETO members
has been going truly well,

144
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.840
and we will have updates
for you all soon.

145
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.030
The exciting news for a long time.

146
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.890
We can call this
an unprecedented victory.

147
00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.530
This is far from a victory.

148
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:08.000
As the Chinese saying goes,
no success in the revolution yet,

149
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.050
so hard work is still needed.

150
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.720
We only knew Trisolarans
are heading for the Earth.

151
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.650
It's not a victory at all.

152
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.270
While you were playing the
game, the Battle Command Center

153
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.600
already attacked
their server on satellite.

154
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.790
At this critical moment, they kept
operating and announced the finale.

155
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.460
They are tough.

156
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.750
It showed
they weren't afraid of your attack,

157
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.000
or they have prepared for it.

158
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.770
It's the same with Chang's safe houses.
They knew everything.

159
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.820
In the war against Trisolarans,
we seem to have no secret to them.

160
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.030
How far are they from us?

161
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.600
Four light-years.

162
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.770
Four light-years.

163
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.820
How soon will they arrive?

164
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.910
The Trisolaran Fleet flights
at one-tenth the speed of light.

165
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:26.200
It should take only 40 years.

166
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.890
But they said in the game that
it would take more than 400 years.

167
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.080
Why?

168
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.150
Did you or they miscalculate?

169
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.840
Four light-years are the distance
light travels in four years.

170
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.790
The speed is one-tenth
the speed of light.

171
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.960
Four divided by zero point one.
Can you make a mistake?

172
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.150
So why?
Are they trying to mislead us?

173
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.500
No need.

174
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.910
I think, the current time difference

175
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.390
maybe due to the difference
in the measurement of time

176
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.030
between the Earth
and the Three-Body Civilization.

177
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.360
We know nothing
about interstellar flight.

178
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.840
So now the worst
outcome is that in 40 years,

179
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.630
we will see the arrival
of the Trisolarans.

180
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.080
Only 40 years.

181
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.820
Will we be able to
build a strong enough defense system?

182
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.440
No.

183
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.890
The worst outcome is that
they were in flight 40 years ago.

184
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.290
We don't know when they started moving.

185
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.640
The members of ETO is eviler than cults.

186
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.750
They are traitors.

187
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.640
I just talked with Wang Miao that

188
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.240
these traitors
are divided into different sects.

189
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.270
That's right.

190
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:46.830
They belong to different sects
and often disagree with other sects.

191
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.000
Some sects slander
and even attack each other.

192
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.270
Most of these arrested
were the Redemptionists.

193
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.110
They aim to solve the Three-Body Problem.

194
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:09.030
So, most game players
belong to the Redemptionists.

195
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.720
Shen Yufei should be a Redemptionist.

196
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.300
Wei Cheng is still calculating for her.

197
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.270
But it turns out there's no solution
to the Three-Body Problem.

198
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.110
The Adventists believe
the Three-Body Problem has no solution.

199
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:28.310
This sect claims
human race should be destroyed.

200
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.550
They eagerly await
the coming of the Lord.

201
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.440
That is, they do this in the hope that

202
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.750
they will be saved from death
when the Lord comes.

203
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.680
The Survivors believe
the Lord won't kill them.

204
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.440
They are optimistic.

205
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.790
According to our interrogation,

206
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.750
it seems that the other two sects
look down on them.

207
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.590
The major divide of ETO exists

208
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.480
in the Redemptionists and the Adventists.

209
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.920
Shen Yufei was a Redemptionist.

210
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.310
His rival, Pan Han, is an Adventist.

211
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.790
The information we have now
is from Pan Han's computer,

212
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.160
but the list is all about
the Redemptionists.

213
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.660
It seems like the faction within the ETO.

214
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.640
How did they connect with the Lord?

215
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.920
So far, no connection with the
so-called Lord has been found.

216
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.440
The person who can connect with the Lord
should be their leader.

217
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.400
There are many sects in ETO.

218
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.960
How can there be no leader?

219
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.590
They mentioned a person.

220
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.680
I also doubted this person
has something to do with the ETO.

221
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.290
In ETO, they call her

222
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.110
Commander.

223
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.580
(Commander)

224
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.200
What is on the flash drive?

225
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.750
I have told you.
We are decoding it. It's unknown.

226
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.640
Are you afraid that the contents of
the flash drive will bring danger to me?

227
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.640
Yes.

228
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.750
The contents of it are dangerous for you.

229
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.240
So I came to tell you
to stop your investigation.

230
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.960
Do you think I'm the one
who's afraid of danger?

231
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.360
You are not, but I am.

232
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.480
We are creatures
of backward civilization.

233
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.160
If the creatures of advanced civilization
want to kill you, I can't protect you,

234
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.880
so does the Battle Command Center.

235
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.070
Not to mention yourself.

236
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.180
Don't you see?

237
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.440
Last night, some of our members

238
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.500
in the European Combat Zone
have been arrested for no reason.

239
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.240
The truth must be known to more people.

240
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.310
It happened in Europe.

241
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.350
We need the help of foreign media.

242
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.070
The environmental protection issues
investigated abroad last time

243
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.640
have been reported by foreign media.

244
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.780
They received a good response.

245
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.002
(Commander The Redemptionists
(Solve the Three-Body Problem))

246
00:21:26.002 --> 00:21:30.200
(The Adventists (Destroy)
The Redemptionists)

247
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.590
I felt a growing suspicion that

248
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.030
this information was deliberately leaked
to Mu Xing by Pan Han.

249
00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.960
Don't arrest Pan Han now.

250
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.110
He can help us find more information.

251
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.500
We should protect Mu Xing now.

252
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.440
I was exposed to the data
when I worked for my master's degree.

253
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.550
I was shocked at first,
and then I tried to change it.

254
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:59.110
If you don't save yourself,
Buddha can't help you.

255
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.050
Then I met her.

256
00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.510
Commander gave me hope again.

257
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.590
Commander?

258
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.350
Lord will come to create a bright,

259
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.680
new and advanced human civilization.

260
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.330
Commander is the one
who's listened to the voice of the Lord.

261
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.850
I'm sure you'll meet her one day.

262
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.460
Thank you.

263
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:38.380
Has anyone ever heard
the voice of the Lord?

264
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.680
(The waves traveled alone
through the galaxy, )

265
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.550
(messaging our confusion to the Lord
and bringing back hope for us.)

266
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.510
(How great it is!)

267
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.250
(I'll never forget this moment.)

268
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960
Stop it.

269
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.350
- What are you doing?
- You are an unlicensed driver, right?

270
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.510
- Forget it.
- Stop it.

271
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.960
- What are you doing?
- Doing my duty.

272
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.350
- Work with me. Please!
- Let me go.

273
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.750
Come here.

274
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.440
What are you doing?

275
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.750
- Get on. Get on.
- What's wrong with you?

276
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.940
Listen to me.

277
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.940
I... Since you continued to
investigate, I can only detain you.

278
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.590
Are you being stubborn?

279
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.400
I'm useful to them.

280
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.880
If I suddenly disappear,
he'll be suspicious.

281
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.270
Just give me 24 hours.

282
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.750
After I do what he asked me to do,
I'll find an excuse to disappear.

283
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.310
24 hours is too long.

284
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.920
Tell them.

285
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.590
It's hard to do it.

286
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.271
Okay.

287
00:23:54.271 --> 00:23:55.720
What?

288
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.240
What's the exact time?

289
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.570
Noon tomorrow.

290
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.350
8 o'clock this evening.

291
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.160
After your hand-off,
I will come to get you.

292
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.160
How about 10 o'clock tomorrow?

293
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.640
10 o'clock this evening.

294
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.401
Report your work.

295
00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:10.350
After your hand-off,
I will come to get you.

296
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.880
Okay?

297
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.850
Okay, okay.

298
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.570
Hand off.

299
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.400
You can go.

300
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.270
10 o'clock this evening.
I'll buy you coffee.

301
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.830
I'm not a coffee guy.

302
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.180
Get off.

303
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.500
I heard you're powerful.

304
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.750
But I can't repel your bullet.

305
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.790
We are not enemies.

306
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.810
I invited you here for Commander.

307
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.310
Many members in Europe were arrested.

308
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.880
I found that it had something to do
with a journalist, Mu Xing.

309
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.590
Nothing to do with you, huh?

310
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.530
Did you have anything to do
with Shen Yufei's death?

311
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.590
I know you doubt me.

312
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.070
But it doesn't matter.

313
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:54.200
I will report all these things
to Commander in the conference.

314
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.770
You called me for Commander?

315
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.070
The journalist, Mu Xing,
should have found the information

316
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:08.230
that Commander was present
in the Second Red Coast Base in 1996.

317
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.160
The conference is coming.

318
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.850
Protect Commander.

319
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.200
(I was exposed to the data
when I worked for my master's degree.)

320
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.750
(I was shocked at first,

I think that girl
took my file by mistake.

No.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.200
Nothing.

378

Cabling revamp work is underway
on this road.

380

The surveillance was all dismantled.

381
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.240
It wasn't an accident,
but an intended crime.

382

In addition,
Mu Xing's digital recorder was gone.

383

several digital recorders.

387

I have a question.

388
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.510
Do I have to take milk and sugar
with my coffee?

389

I traced Tsinghua University?)

Mu Xing's last words
were sending messages to us.

409

She found their Commander and
tracked down to Tsinghua University.

410

The suspect's voiceprint was identified.

414

Then?

421
00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.150
The suspect is an expert
in anti-tracking.

422
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.780
She deliberately avoided surveillance.

423
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.010
What's it?

424
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.400
It's from CVS.

425
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.110
When someone enters or exits a CVS,
there will be this opening tone.

426
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.260
Mu Xing bought something on the way.

427
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.710
According to this record,

428
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.800
Mu Xing was killed
in two hours and 17 minutes.

429
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.480
This sound rang
in two hours and three minutes.

430

from the spot.

She was in heels.

434
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.070
Well, back up.

435
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.090
Back up.

436
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:43.670

Before it came along,
this was the only lane that had traffic.

441

After it left,
other cars began to drive in this lane.

It has been parked
outside the monitoring.

- I'll get the owner's information.
- No need.

445
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.860
It must be a fake-licensed car.

446
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:31.940
I need you to check all the traffic cameras
on this vehicle.

- Investigate this case with K1303 murder.
- Yes, sir.

456

Captain Shi, we found the car.

457
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.880
On the West Side Highway,
the camera pictured the driver's face.

It's a blurry version.

Chen Xue also bought
the ticket for K1303.

463

That much seems to be clear.
She's the suspect in both murders.

464

for arresting her.

The journalist who found the
list for us was killed last night.

Didn't you ask her to stop investigating
the other day?

475
00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.800
The suspect is Chen Xue.

476
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.610
She's a member of ETO.

477
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.110
How do you know she's a member of ETO?

478
00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.960
Mu Xing had the habit of recording.

479

We found a digital recorder on the spot.

480

Chen Xue said she must protect Commander.

481
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.510
Do you remember the murder in K1303?

482
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:09.710
A man was killed in the toilet.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.030
His neck was wrung.

484
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.580
Mu Xing died the same way.

485
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:19.070
Chen Xue also bought a ticket for K1303.

486
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:25.860
Mu Xing died because she found
who's the Commander of ETO?

487
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.190
What extent had she traced to?

488
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.170
She tracked down Tsinghua University

489
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.210
before she died.
