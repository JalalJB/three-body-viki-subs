=Episode 28=

3
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.510
The last but also
the most important question.

4
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:59.500
So far, the Trisolaris has only
sent radio waves to the Earth?

5
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.750
Almost true.

6
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.800
Almost?

7
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.190
The current Trisolaran civilization

8
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.080
(is capable of space travel
at one-tenth the speed of light.)

9
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.750
(This technology leap occurred
a few decades ago in Earth years.)

10
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.360
(Before that point, their maximum speed)

11
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.630
(had hovered around one-thousandth
the speed of light.)

12
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.080
(The tiny probes
that they sent to the Earth)

13
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.520
(have not even completed one-hundredth)

14
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.840
of the journey between there and here.

15
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.520
(If the Trisolaran Fleet that
had been launched)

16
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.030
is capable of flight
at one-tenth the speed of light,

17
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.240
it should take only 40 years
to reach the solar system.

18
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.280
Why do you say that it would take
more than 400 years?

19
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.520
Here's the thing.

20
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.080
The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet
is composed of incredibly

21
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.520
(massive spaceships.)

22
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.080
(Accelerating them is a slow process.)

23
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.910
(One-tenth the speed of light
is only their maximum speed, )

24
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.030
(but they cannot cruise
at this speed for long)

25
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.360
(before decelerating.)

26
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.190
(So, the time it takes
the Trisolaran Fleet)

27
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.910
(to reach the solar system)

28
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.910
(is ten times longer than
that of a small probe.)

29
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.400
Also, the source of propulsion
for the Trisolaran ships

30
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.150
is matter-antimatter annihilation.

31
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.500
Matter-antimatter annihilation?

32
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.520
Then is there a large magnetic field
in front of each ship?

33
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.520
Is there a large magnetic field
in front of each ship?

34
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.800
Yes.

35
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.520
(Theoretically,
the field is shaped like a funnel)

36
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.280
(to collect antimatter particles
from space.)

37
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.710
(This collection process is slow, )

38
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.710
(and only after a long wait
can it gather)

39
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.840
(enough antimatter to allow the ship)

40
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.580
(to accelerate for a brief period.)

41
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.500
If that's the case, it
indeed takes 400 years.

42
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.510
Then what did you mean by
"almost" just now?

43
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.190
We're talking about

44
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.270
the speed of space flight
within a certain context.

45
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.360
Outside this context,
even backward human beings

46
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.430
(are capable of
accelerating certain objects)

47
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.310
(to close to the speed of light.)

48
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.510
By "context", she probably means
at the macro scale.

49
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.800
At a micro scale, we can already
use high-energy particle accelerators

50
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.100
to speed up micro particles
to near the speed of light.

51
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.660
Those micro particles you mentioned
are the "objects", right?

52
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.160
You're clever.

53
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.120
I'm flattered.

54
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.620
I have the world's
foremost scientists behind me.

55
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.680
Yes, they're micro particles.

56
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.600
Six years ago,
in the distant triple star system,

57
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.360
Trisolaris accelerated two hydrogen
nuclei to near the speed of light

58
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.630
(and shot them toward the solar system.)

59
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.750
(These two hydrogen nuclei, or protons, )

60
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.920
(arrived at the solar system
two years ago, )

61
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.890
(then reached the Earth.)

62
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.240
Two protons?

63
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.510
They only sent two protons?

64
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.070
That's almost nothing.

65
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.500
General Chang, you also said "almost".

66
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.680
That's the limit of Trisolaran power.

67
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.310
They can only accelerate something

68
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.750
as small as a proton
to near the speed of light.

69
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.180
Over a distance of four light-years,
they can only send two protons.

70
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.040
(At the macroscopic level,
two protons are nothing.)

71
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.680
(Even a single cilium on a bacterium)

72
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.000
(would include several billion protons.)

73
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.310
(What's the point?)

74
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.480
They're a lock.

75
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.740
A lock? What are they locking?

76
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.060
The progress of human science.

77
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.360
(During the four and a half centuries)

78
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.270
(until the arrival
of the Trisolaran Fleet, )

79
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.160
(due to the existence
of the two protons, )

80
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.040
(humanity will not be able to make)

81
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.470
any important scientific developments.

82
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.310
Evans once said that the day of arrival

83
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.540
of the two protons was also
the day that human science died.

84
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.740
(So you already knew that
the protons sealed off human science.)

85
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.310
(Professor David
of Gadayork University, )

86
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.830
(committed suicide a month ago.)

87
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.630
(The astrophysicist of Country A...)

88
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.800
(Human science will never progress.)

89
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.720
(Yang Dong's experiment
will never succeed.)

90
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.660
Physics doesn't exist.

91
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.220
(Why didn't you
tell her the truth earlier?)

92
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.980
Is everything I know

93
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.570
the truth?

94
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.010
General Chang, this is Wang Miao.

95
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.960
OK, thanks, Professor Ye.

96
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.150
Let's call it a day.

97
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.170
Someone wants to see you.

98
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.340
Thank you for seeing me.

99
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:19.370
There is a question that
I haven't answered you.

100
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.100
Is it about Yang Dong?

101
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.530
Dong

102
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.790
didn't like to watch
the news on current events,

103
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:46.120
because she had a basic belief
that life and the world might be ugly,

104
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.410
but at the end of the micro and
macro, it was harmonious and perfect.

105
00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:01.490
(The daily world was just a foam
floating on the perfect ocean.)

106
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.510
(But because the protons interfered with
the accelerator experiment, )

107
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.980
Don't come over.

108
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.230
(the daily world became
a beautiful presentation instead.)

109
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.720
(The micro it contained)

110
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.510
(and the macro that contained it)

111
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.800
(might be more chaotic and uglier.)

112
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.010
(So her faith collapsed.)

113
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.250
(She actually knew that)

114
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.050
she didn't have to think that way.

115
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.500
Without physics, she could still live.

116
00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.390
(She made choices and efforts, )

117
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.000
(trying to live peacefully)

118
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.860
(like an ordinary woman.)

119
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.270
(For her, )

120
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:15.230
(half of her life had been destroyed.)

121
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.500
I talked with Shen Yufei.

122
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.320
Yang Dong tried to make changes.

123
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.770
Perhaps she did that to save herself.

124
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.250
But I don't know

125
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.170
why she eventually chose to end her life.

126
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.170
That's because I destroyed

127
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.790
the other half of her life.

128
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.270
(If I was right, )

129
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.630
(Dong)

130
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.270
(should have accidentally seen)

131
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.790
(the files on my computer
that I didn't delete, )

132
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.380
(and found out)

133
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.050
(about my secrets with Trisolaris.)

134
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.550
(She never thought that)

135
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.240
(her mom who kept her company)

136
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.430
(was a different person, )

137
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.510
(a person)

138
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.240
(she couldn't)

139
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.630
(even believe)

140
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.240
(might exist.)

141
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.500
(The two things together)

142
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.790
(constituted her entire life.)

143
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.940
But,

144
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.340
they were actually one thing.

145
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.530
To be exact,

146
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.340
I was the one

147
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.620
who destroyed Dong's life.

148
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.320
♪ The cruel choice of nature ♪

149
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.550
(All the evidence
points to a single conclusion.)

150
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.500
(Physics has never existed, )

151
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.670
(and will never exist.)

152
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:20.670
(I know what I'm doing
is irresponsible.)

153
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.030
(But I have no choice.)

154
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:26.200
(Triazolam)

155
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.720
I know you always think

156
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.010
there are many doubts
about Yang Dong's death.

157
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.460
I have doubts, too.

158
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:14.010
If I tell you, it's partly
because of physics,

159
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:22.410
and partly because of Professor
Ye, will it clear your doubts?

160
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.130
What do you think?

161
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.850
Physics has never existed,
and will never exist.

162
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.360
Honestly, I think just the opposite.

163
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.530
I think Yang Dong's suicide note
becomes even more strange.

164
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.870
Let's do a sociological
thought experiment

165
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.790
with Yang Dong as an example.

166
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.440
Quantum collision failed.

167
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.010
The foundation of physics
seemed to have collapsed.

168
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.320
(But if she knew it was because
two protons had locked human science, )

169
00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.960
(she should have found
reasonable explanations)

170
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.650
(for the anomalies
in theoretical physics.)

171
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.390
(Profess Ye's story indeed
destroyed her hope, )

172
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.600
(but at the same time, she could)

173
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.590
(at least see the reason why
human physics didn't exist)

174
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.340
(was because of
the intervention of Trisolarans.)

175
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.860
This should be new hope.

176
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.390
Yang Dong couldn't have failed
to see this, but she still chose...

177
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.480
chose to kill herself.

178
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.630
She must have seen
something more long-term than us.

179
00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.790
But what did she see?

180
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.360
How did she see?

181
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.170
Both of us can't figure it out.

182
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.550
Your experiment just now
took the two protons locking the Earth

183
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.400
as a necessary condition.

184
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.550
Do you really believe that?

185
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.200
The Trisolarans
shot two protons at the Earth

186
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.400
from four light-years away (and
they both reached the target.)

187
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.640
(That accuracy is incredible.)

188
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.240
(You know there are numerous obstacles
between there and here.)

189
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.720
(And both the solar system
and the Earth are moving.)

190
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.640
It's like... It would
require more precision

191
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.240
than shooting a mosquito here from Pluto.

192
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.830
The shooter is beyond imagination, right?

193
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.740
So what does that mean?

194
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.550
I don't know.

195
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.740
I don't know.

196
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.510
What do you think those micro particles

197
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.940
such as protons, neutrons
and electrons look like?

198
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.550
They would just look like a point,
but with different structures.

199
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.050
The image in my head
is more realistic than yours.

200
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.510
Look what this is.

201
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.160
A cigarette filter.

202
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.270
Looking at this tiny thing
from where you stand,

203
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.790
how would you describe it?

204
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.460
It's practically just a point.

205
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.790
If this little sponge is spread open,
the adsorbent surface area

206
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.020
can be as large as my living room.

207
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.510
Do you smoke pipes?

208
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.110
I don't smoke.

209
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.310
Pipes use a more advanced filter.

210
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.350
Three yuan for one.

211
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.400
It's filled with active charcoal.

212
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.200
If you take out all the infill,
it looks like mouse droppings.

213
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.350
But spread open,

214
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.920
the adsorbent surface formed by
the tiny holes inside

215
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.310
is as large as a tennis court.

216
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.980
This is why active charcoal
is so adsorbent.

217
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.200
So, what are you trying to say?

218
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.350
Well, the sponge or active charcoal
is three-dimensional.

219
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.030
But their adsorbent surfaces
are two-dimensional.

220
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.000
Thus, you can see how a
high-dimensional structure

221
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.900
can contain a huge
low-dimensional structure.

222
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.030
But at the macroscopic level,

223
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.240
this is the limit of the ability
for high-dimensional space

224
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.830
to contain low-dimensional space.

225
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.000
Because God was stingy.

226
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.270
During the big bang, he only

227
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.980
provided the macroscopic world
with three dimensions,

228
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.440
but this doesn't mean that
higher dimensions don't exist.

229
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.790
Up to eight dimensions
are locked within the micro scale.

230
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.610
(And added to the three dimensions
at the macro scale, )

231
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.900
(an eleven-dimensional space-time
exists within fundamental particles.)

232
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.400
So what?

233
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.830
What do you think is the mark of a
civilization's technological advancement

234
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.050
in the universe?

235
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.680
The view of dimensions.

236
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.660
I think it's the ability to control
and make use of micro dimensions.

237
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.440
Making use of fundamental particles
is something that our ancestors

238
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.240
already did back when
they drilled wood to make a fire.

239
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.400
Utilizing chemical reactions is just

240
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.270
manipulating micro particles
at the one-dimensional level.

241
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.640
Of course, this utilization
also progressed from crude to advanced,

242
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.790
from bonfires to steam engines,
and then generators.

243
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.000
But now, the ability for humans to manipulate
micro particles at the macro level

244
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.960
has reached a peak.

245
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.880
We have computers and nanomaterials.

246
00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.960
But all of this, from the perspective of a more
advanced civilization in the universe,

247
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.590
is accomplished without
unlocking the many dimensions.

248
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.220
That's why
they think of humans as mere turkeys.

249
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:24.390
What does all you said have
to do with those two protons?

250
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.820
Ultimately, what can they do?

251
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.790
A single cilium on a bacterium
can contain several billion protons.

252
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:35.720
Even if the two protons turned entirely
into energy on the tip of my finger,

253
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.920
at most it would feel like a pinprick.

254
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.550
Even if they turned into energy
on a bacterium,

255
00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.400
the bacterium probably
wouldn't feel anything.

256
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.920
Not to mention you.

257
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.070
Then what were you trying to say?

258
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.720
Nothing.

259
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.920
I don't know anything.

260
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.440
What can a turkey know?

261
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.510
But about this thing,
you know more than I do.

262
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.240
You are not at a loss as I am.

263
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.830
At least you can tell me what you know.

264
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.570
- Tell you what I know?
- Yes.

265
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.140
If I tell you what I know, you
really won't be able to sleep.

266
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.700
What's the point of worrying?

267
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.960
Learn from Shi Qiang.

268
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.700
Just do the best
within your responsibility.

269
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:25.050
I'll go drinking
and then go back to sleep like a turkey.

270
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.480
Mom. Mom.

271
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.400
Look, Dad is smoking.

272
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.160
When did you come in?

273
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.000
Play outside.

274
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.440
Let Dad do his work.

275
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.270
Mom, don't let Dad smoke.

276
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.200
OK. I won't let Dad smoke.

277
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.420
Go and play.

278
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.310
What's wrong?

279
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.200
Is there a problem with your experiment?

280
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.680
Why do you say that?

281
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.440
The last time you stared
at something in a daze was when

282
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.810
the nanomaterial lab was built.

283
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.810
That wasn't worth mentioning.

284
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.570
Is that so serious?

285
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.640
No.

286
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.030
I mean I was young back then.

287
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.110
When I had a problem,
I always thought it was big.

288
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.000
Now looking back, they were nothing.

289
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.270
All academic problems
are a matter of time.

290
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.680
Over time, all problems can be solved.

291
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.720
Dad,
it's your turn to tell me a story today.

292
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.000
Doudou, don't disturb Dad.

293
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.350
It doesn't matter.
I happen to be free today.

294
00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.240
Come.

295
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.510
Dad will tell you how
a magician outwitted a dragon.

296
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.071
Come.

297
00:23:54.071 --> 00:23:56.850
Be a good girl.

298
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.940
Come.

299
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.030
Once upon a time,
there was a magician who had been

300
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:13.790
trying to make magic potions
and practice magic.

301
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.750
But one day, a dragon came.

302
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:23.070
It destroyed the magician's magic hut,
knocked over his magic potion,

303
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:28.510
(and took away the magic fruit
that the magician survived on.)

304
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.640
(The magician didn't give up.)

305
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.960
He went through countless hardships
to find the dragon's nest,

306
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.900
and declared war on it.

307
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.990
(He dodged the dragon's huge tail,
and extinguished the flames it spewed.)

308
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.270
At last, the magician defeated the dragon

309
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:51.240
and took back his magic fruit.

310
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.030
Dad, you're also a magician.

311
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.830
You magically put the egg in the bottle.

312
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.880
So you are brave, too.

313
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.400
Thanks.

314
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.680
Why did the dragon fight the magician?

315
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.590
Is there any chance that
they finally became friends

316
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.500
and fought no more?

317
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:16.830
Wang Miao, your friend came to see you.

318
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.160
Dad, it must be the dragon.

319
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.270
Be careful.

320
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.880
Dad is a magician.

321
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.250
Dad isn't afraid.

322
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.550
Are you Wang Miao?

323
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:40.920
Excuse me, you can't smoke here.

324
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.980
The hallway, we can talk in the hallway.
You can't smoke there either.

325
00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.680
(Please keep the hallway clean
and do not smoke)

326
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.240
Are you OK?

327
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.480
Yes.

328
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.880
I just recollected the old days.

329
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.400
I mean your health.

330
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.030
I'm fine.

331
00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:00.681
Don't worry.

332
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:02.960
I'm not radioactive anymore.

333
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.830
Because of a tiny nuclear bomb,
they've washed me inside and outside

334
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.110
like a flour sack.

335
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.960
No sooner than you left the hospital,
you came to knock on my door.

336
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.791
Is it urgent?

337
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:13.920
It's urgent.

338
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.880
Come with me.

339
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.140
No, I'm busy this afternoon.

340
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.880
This afternoon,
we'll rearrange your schedule.

341
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.880
There's a car waiting downstairs.

342
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.310
Will you come or not?

343
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.510
I want to recall the old days, too.

344
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.830
Will you come or not?

345
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.090
Do I have a choice?

346
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.400
I read Ye Wenjie's interrogation record.

347
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.310
It said that the Trisolarans sent
two protons to the earth.

348
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.400
What are the protons?

349
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.240
What's the Trisolarans' purpose?

350
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.510
The two protons they sent
are too small to be seen.

351
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.640
But they can lock human science.

352
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.750
Just like when you fought with someone,

353
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.160
you did your utmost,
while by throwing two hairs,

354
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.200
your opponent made you stiff
and unable to move.

355
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:13.160
This information is like the countdown
and weighs heavily on our minds.

356
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.030
(Don't you feel that everyone here)

357
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.980
(is anxious and worried?)

358
00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.110
(Even the blue whale fossil)

359
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:33.660
(seems to become rougher and yellower.)

360
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.460
Is that the sense of vicissitudes
you educated people always say?

361
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.550
It feels like human civilization
soon became aging.

362
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.070
Cut the crap.

363
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.750
It's only been a month.

364
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.160
What civilization would age so fast?

365
00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.180
Wang Miao, answer me, do you want to

366
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.570
play a game with me and all humanity?

367
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.920
Do I have a choice?

368
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.240
Good.

369
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.220
Come.

370
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.070
Dr. Ding and I seem to be
the only scientists here.

371
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:48.750
You were not supposed to
attend the meeting, not even me.

372
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.200
Don't you see
they are all military officers?

373
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.900
I insisted on
attending the meeting with you.

374
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.750
Why did you insist on doing this?

375
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.200
We can do nothing to help arrest Evans.

376
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.720
Not necessarily.

377
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.790
The first time I saw you, I thought,

378
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.070
perhaps, you're a good knife for murder.

379
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.880
Are you still in the mood to joke?

380
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.880
I didn't joke.

381
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.880
Probably, the two of us are going to

382
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.550
take the lead, make our mark,
and stand out.

383
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.140
How do you like my idioms?

384
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.400
Good morning.

385
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.270
Everyone at this meeting

386
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.070
now has a basic understanding
of the situation.

387
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:54.480
According to our agreement,
we shared information in sync.

388
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.920
I'm sorry to tell you,

389
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.000
the war between alien invaders
and humanity has begun.

390
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.680
(Some may say, for now,
our opponents are still human.)

391
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.510
(After all, our descendants
won't face the Trisolarans)

392
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:17.240
(for another four and a half centuries.)

393
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.240
(Yet, in essence,
these traitors to the human race)

394
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.160
(like the ETO can also
be seen as enemies)

395
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.920
(from outside human civilization.)

396
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:34.000
We have never faced an enemy like this.

397
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.720
So our next common objective

398
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.350
is to capture the intercepted
Trisolaran messages

399
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.960
stored on Judgment Day?

400
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.550
Yes.

401
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:52.820
These messages may have
great significance for our survival.

402
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.950
Please look.

403
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.200
This is Judgment Day.

404
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.440
(We've tracked its location by satellite.)

405
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.790
(The ship is still
sailing on the Atlantic freely.)

406
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.200
(It has already submitted plans
to the Panama Canal Authority)

407
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.550
(to pass through the canal)

408
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.310
in four days.

409
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.920
This seems to be our
best opportunity to take action.

410
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.550
Perhaps, such an opportunity
will never arise again.

411
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.830
The purpose of this meeting

412
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:27.160
is to discuss possible plans
of operation,

413
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.640
and then report one to three of
our best suggestions to Central.

414
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.160
This operation is very difficult.

415
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.030
Because any plan must
guarantee one thing,

416
00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:47.820
which is the secure capture
of the Trisolaran messages.

417
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.030
According to the information
from the captured ETOs,

418
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:57.200
Judgment Day was rebuilt
from an old oil tanker.

419
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.550
(But the superstructure and the interior)

420
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.240
(have been extensively renovated)

421
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.030
(with complex structures,
rooms and passage ways.)

422
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:08.440
(And the crew having
lived on the ship for over a month)

423
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.270
(still need a map
to navigate some areas, )

424
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.090
(which we don't have.)

425
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.830
Right now, we don't even know

426
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:23.110
the location of the computing center
on Judgment Day,

427
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.550
(or whether the Trisolaran messages
are stored there, )

428
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.350
(or how many copies they have.)

429
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.310
(The only way to achieve our objective)

430
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:36.920
(is to completely capture
and control Judgment Day.)

431
00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.310
The most difficult part is
preventing the enemy from erasing

432
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.200
Trisolaran data during our attack.

433
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:48.400
If they just emptied a cartridge clip
at the server hard drive,

434
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.720
(it would all be over.)

435
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.680
(It would take 10 seconds at most.)

436
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.640
So basically, we need to clear the ship,
its entire crew,

437
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.350
(find the disk or drive, )

438
00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.400
(or which we have no idea
of its actual location)

439
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.960
(without a map, without causing)

440
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.550
(any substantial damage
or raising any alarms)

441
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.750
(all in 10 seconds.)

442
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.640
Do we have any spies
on Judgment Day to control or move

443
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:20.070
the storage equipment elsewhere
right before our operation?

444
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.140
No.

445
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:34.250
Then we have nothing more
to discuss except bullshit.

446
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.960
A ball lightning weapon
can eliminate all personnel

447
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.500
within an enclosed structure
without harming other equipment.

448
00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.000
I don't think this is feasible.

449
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.270
We don't know if the ship has been
equipped with magnetic walls

450
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.700
to shield against ball lightning.

451
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.710
(Also, the ball lightning needs
some time to release its energy, )

452
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:14.070
(10 seconds at least, or one minute,
even longer.)

453
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.780
(They will have enough time to react.)

454
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.880
What about a neutron bomb?

455
00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.070
Also there's a problem.

456
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:29.860
The radiation from a neutron bomb
cannot put them to death immediately.

457
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.030
(After the neutron bomb attack, )

458
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:40.070
(the enemy has a lot of time
for a meeting, )

459
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.110
just like us.

460
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.840
Another option is nerve gas.

461
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.880
But from the time of our release to the
time it'll take to get around the ship,

462
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.070
it's more time than we have,

463
00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.420
so that doesn't meet
the general's requirements.

464
00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:05.300
The only other choices are
concussion bombs or infrasonic waves.

465
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.710
I use concussion bombs,
the toys, in police work.

466
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.440
They can indeed stun people
inside a building into unconsciousness,

467
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.400
but they're only good for a room or two.

468
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.840
Do you have any concussion bombs
big enough to stun

469
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.110
a whole ship full of people?

470
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.070
No.

471
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:36.000
Even if we had,
such a large explosive device

472
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.030
would certainly damage
equipment inside the ship.

473
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.630
What about infrasonic weapons?

474
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.710
No, it's not ready yet.
We're still in testing.

475
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.880
It's not ready for field.

476
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.000
Besides, the power we will
need for a ship that size...

477
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.440
It will barely be enough to cause

478
00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.630
some dizzy spews or
maybe a bit of nausea.

479
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.920
I told you
all we have left to discuss is bullshit.

480
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.320
But you seemed to have ignored me.

481
00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.710
Can't you translate the word "bullshit"?

482
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.550
The general said time was of the essence.

483
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.630
Hurry up.

484
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.650
Say what else have you got.

485
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.920
Are we going to
let the policeman run this?

486
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.500
Are you even qualified?

487
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.900
What do you mean?

488
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.150
I'm a policeman, so what?

489
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.320
A policeman isn't qualified.

490
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.280
So are you even qualified?

491
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.590
Colonel Stanton has been one of

492
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.510
the longest standing experts
in special ops,

493
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.650
and he has been in every
major operations since the Vietnam War.

494
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.420
I see.

495
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.070
Fine.

496
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.630
Then let me tell you why I'm qualified.

497
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:59.880
Before I became a policeman,
I was also in the military.

498
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.400
My reconnaissance squad once
sneaked dozens of kilometers

499
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400
behind the enemy,

500
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.440
and captured a hydroelectric station
under heavy guard.

501
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.110
We prevented the enemy's plan
to demolish the dam with explosives,

502
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.190
which would have flooded
the attack route for our army.

503
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.990
That's why I'm qualified.

504
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:24.170
I defeated an enemy
who once defeated you.

505
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.320
Shi, say your plan.
Don't bring up irrelevant matters.

506
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.030
I don't think we need to continue
listening to this police.

507
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:35.110
Police?

508
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.360
I heard that word twice.

509
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.070
What?

510
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.110
You look down upon the police, don't you?

511
00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.440
To drop some bombs
and turn that ship into smithereens,

512
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.880
you military are the experts.

513
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.190
But to retrieve something
out of it without damage,

514
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:52.960
I don't care how many stars
are on your shoulder,

515
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.260
you aren't even as good as a thief.

516
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.920
For this kind of thing,
you have to think outside the box.

517
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.920
Out of the box.

518
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:09.280
You will never be as
good at it as criminals,

519
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.000
masters of out-of-the-box thinking.

520
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.630
Criminals could steal one car
out of a moving train.

521
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.190
They reconnected the cars before and
after the stolen one so that the train

522
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.920
got all the way to its destination.

523
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.440
The only tools they used
were a length of wire cable

524
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.320
and a few steel hooks.

525
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.960
Those are the real special ops experts.

526
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.440
And as a criminal cop

527
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.590
who has been playing cat and mouse
with them for more than a decade,

528
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.880
I've received the best education
and training from them.

529
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.631
Enough.

530
00:38:38.631 --> 00:38:40.360
Tell us your plan.

531
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.030
Otherwise, shut up!

532
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.320
General,
there are so many important people here

533
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.150
that I didn't think
it was my place to speak.

534
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.150
And I was afraid that
you would say I was rude.

535
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.480
Now I see...

536
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.840
You're already being rude!
Tell us your out-of-the-box plan.

537
00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.840
OK.

538
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.190
Look.

539
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.920
The middle
of the long table is the canal.

540
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.690
The iron frames are the banks.

541
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.480
This is Judgment Day.

542
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.280
I cannot put up with this idiot!

543
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.280
Get out of here!

544
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.400
I'll be done soon.

545
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.320
One minute.

546
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.860
Give me one minute.

547
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.230
One more.

548
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.800
Cigar.

549
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.860
One more.

550
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:32.670
We set up two pillars
on the shores of the canal,

551
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:38.190
and then between them
we string many parallel, thin filaments.

552
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:43.460
The filaments are the nanomaterial
developed by Professor Wang, Flying Knife.

553
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.880
Flying Blade.

554
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.760
Yeah, Flying Blade.

555
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.230
Nanomaterial.

556
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.010
It can cut clean through iron.

557
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.030
Done.

558
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.170
That's it.

559
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.860
Professor Wang,

560
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.920
is Flying Blade really
in the form of filaments?

561
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.880
Given our current
molecular construction technique,

562
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.920
the only form we can make is a filament.

563
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.360
The thickness is about one-hundredth
the thickness of human hair.

564
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.590
Could we get enough of that in time?

565
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.360
That depends on the width of the canal
and the height of the ship.

566
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.590
The narrowest point of the canal
is 150 meters wide.

567
00:40:54.590 --> 00:41:01.500
The Judgment Day is 31 meters tall,
with a draft of eight meters or so.

568
00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.960
There's probably enough.

569
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.000
Probably.

570
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.190
What if the equipment
holding the Trisolaran data,

571
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:17.790
the hard drives,
the optical disks, is sliced?

572
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.550
The filaments are extremely sharp,

573
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.670
and the cut surfaces
would be very smooth.

574
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.030
The data in those optical disks,
hard drives and storage

575
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.760
could probably be recovered.

576
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.730
Yeah.

577
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:33.550
Anyone got a better idea?

578
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.000
There's no other way.

579
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.800
Yes, all we can do is this.

580
00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.190
This is our best option so far.

581
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:43.280
All right.

582
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.630
Then let's focus on this
and work out the details.

583
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:50.960
When Judgment Day passes,
can those two pillars

584
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.550
bear the force applied against
the Flying Blade filaments?

585
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.840
Is there any chance the pillars
could be sliced apart first?

586
00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.670
Everyone, here is the thing.

587
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:02.670
The nanomaterial is thick at both ends
and thin in the middle.

588
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.440
We have some material
that are flat sheets.

589
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.550
We can use them to protect
the parts of the column

590
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.190
where the filaments are attached.

591
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.030
In addition, the filaments are too thin
to be seen with the naked eye.

592
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.840
So we need to label them
with fluorescent.

593
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.510
This way, in a special light,

594
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.510
we can check that
whether the filaments are straightened

595
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.980
and arranged neatly.

596
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.030
Judgment Day has a deep draft.

597
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.760
(We also need to consider
the filaments below the waterline.)

598
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.550
(It's hard to set the filaments
below the waterline.)

599
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.110
If we don't have enough time,

600
00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.630
I don't think it will matter.
We shouldn't worry about it.

601
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:41.710
(The parts of the ship below
the waterline are used for engines, )

602
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.000
(fuel, and ballast.)

603
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.110
(The conditions are unsuitable)

604
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.840
(for computer terminals
or other similar systems.)

605
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.030
For the parts above the ship power,
above the waterline however,

606
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.920
(will be much better off
and more effective)

607
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.070
if we can set a tighter nanofilament net.

608
00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:02.550
And the best place to set the trap
is one of the three locks along the canal.

609
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.150
(Judgment Day is built to
Panamax specifications, )

610
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.030
(enough to fill the locks.)

611
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:11.320
(So we only need about 32 meters, )

612
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.960
(a small distance in between.)

613
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.440
(And it will be easier to erect
the pillars and string the filaments, )

614
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.280
(especially for the underwater parts.)

615
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.000
(The situation around the locks
is intricate.)

616
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.670
Also, when the ship moves
through the locks

617
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.150
(it has to need four mules, electric
locomotives on rails, to pull it forward, )

618
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.960
(which moves slowly.)

619
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.550
This is the time when the crew
are all on high alert.

620
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.030
There's a high probability that
we will be discovered during slicing.

621
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.070
(What about the Bridge of the Americas, )

622
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:40.840
right outside the Miraflores Locks?

623
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.880
(The abutments)

624
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.030
(of the two ends on the beach
can serve as the pillars for stringing.)

625
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.280
The distance between
the abutments is too wide.

626
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.480
(We will need a large amount of
Flying Blade materials.)

627
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.590
Can we even make it in such a short time?

628
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.030
(The construction of nanomaterials)

629
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.230
is a very precise and complex process.

630
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.190
If the demand is too large,
I have to say,

631
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.980
I can't make it within the time limit.

632
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.320
Can I suggest
the narrowest part of the Gaillard Cut?

633
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.000
(It's 150 meters in cross.)

634
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.150
(Adding the slack, )

635
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.190
make it better
170 meters for the pillars.

636
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.001
Excuse me.

637
00:44:18.001 --> 00:44:21.000
I need time to calculate it.

638
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.880
Excuse me.

639
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.000
May I use this?

640
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.130
Thanks.

The existing nanomaterials...
If this plan is followed,

642
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.650
the distance between the two filaments
should be at least 50 centimeters.

643
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.960
That is to say, the ship has to
cross the canal during the day.

644
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.360
Why exactly?

645
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.800
People on board have to sleep at night.

646
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.800
(When a person is lying down,
the gap of 50 centimeters is too much.)

647
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.710
(No matter whether he is standing,
squatting, or sitting during the day, )

648
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.780
(the distance)

649
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:31.530
is enough.

650
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.860
You are indeed a devil.
