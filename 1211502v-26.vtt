18
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.230
Wenjie, you must believe me.

19
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.280
Weining has been my comrades
for so many years.

20
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.400
We have a deep personal friendship.
I have to help him with this.

21
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.010
As long as you cooperate, you can avoid
the disastrous consequences.

22
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.400
(At that moment,)

23
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.870
(I knew what Lei Zhicheng was after.)

24
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.710
(He wanted to become)

25
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.680
(the first man to discover
extraterrestrial intelligence.)

26
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.120
(It really was a great opportunity to get
his name into the history textbooks.)

27
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840
Once he reported this,

28
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.750
my reply would soon be discovered.

29
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.190
(Humans would exhaust all technological
and military power)

30
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.240
(to stop Trisolarans from coming.)

31
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.810
(I assented.)

32
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.500
But at that time,

33
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.340
I'd already decided everything.

34
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.150
(I loosened the bolt that secured
the ground wire to the bottom)

35
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.630
(on the main cabinet
in the equipment closet.)

36
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.710
(I would do equipment checkups a lot,)

37
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.250
(so no one noticed what I did.)

38
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.750
(Similar malfunctions
happened many times,)

39
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.360
(that was easy to identify.)

40
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.400
(But no one would think
that it was the ground wire,)

41
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.360
(because it was well fastened.)

42
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360
(No one would touch that.)

43
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.080
(Such problems would often involve)

44
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.470
(the part of the wire on the cliff.)

45
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.360
This is the monitor room. The ground wire
is having a problem again.

46
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.960
OK. I'll get it fixed.

47
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.970
Sure.

48
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.360
Oh, you came back.
Something's wrong with the ground wire.

49
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.120
I'll go check it out.

50
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.120
I'll go. You stay here.

51
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.920
If the surveillance is affected,
you'll report to the command center.

52
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.810
OK.

53
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.980
How is it going?

54
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.740
(Why were you certain
that Lei Zhicheng would go down there?)

55
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.670
(He was a dedicated political officer)

56
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.950
(who would faithfully follow the orders
given to him.)

57
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.370
(He were to be a part of the masses
and always be on the front line.)

58
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.560
(Maybe it was just for show,)

59
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.010
(but he performed well.)

60
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.560
(Whenever there was some difficult
and perilous work at the base,)

61
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.070
(he would always volunteer.)

62
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.160
Well, have you found the problem?

63
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.560
I checked everywhere.

64
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.120
But I didn't find anything.
Maybe the problem isn't here.

65
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.270
Maybe?

66
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.830
What do you mean, maybe?

67
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.510
You don't say "maybe"
when fulfilling an important duty.

68
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.220
- Take off your bag.
- Political Commissar.

69
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.130
(What he did the most)

70
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.040
(was ground wire emergency maintenance,)

71
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.370
(which was a dangerous
and exhausting job.)

72
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.070
Political Commissar.

73
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.130
It's not safe. I'll go down there, too.

74
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.270
(So your plan was to cut the rope)

75
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.300
(during his descent.)

76
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.950
Pilers.

77
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.330
I may need them. All of them.

78
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.700
Many reasons can cause a malfunction.

79
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.190
It may be the exposure
of the ground wire

80
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.360
that causes bad contact

81
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.800
or the dry weather

82
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.160
that leads to poor electrode
conductivity of the ground wire.

83
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.950
It could be a minor
and a complicated one.

84
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.510
You are new here.

85
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.330
Political Commissar Lei won't blame you.

86
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.390
You go back to the main control room

87
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.690
to check if other machines
are functional.

88
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.240
OK.

89
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.130
Go.

90
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.800
(My plan was to cut the rope
with a short hacksaw that was broken)

91
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.300
(into three pieces,)

92
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.800
(and it wouldn't be obvious that
the rope was cut through with the saw.)

93
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.950
Wenjie.

94
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.770
(But I didn't expect that…)

95
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.370
Wenjie.

96
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.500
How is it going?

97
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.790
Who's down there?

98
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.130
Political Commissar Lei.

99
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.250
He's on his own?

100
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.720
That…

101
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.320
That's not right.

102
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.720
It is too hard for him to do it
on his own.

103
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.050
I'll help him.

104
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.650
Use another rope.

105
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.120
No, that won't be necessary.

106
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.390
The rope can take
the weight of the two of us.

107
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.530
Don't worry.

108
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.870
To shorten the time,

109
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.220
three people descended
using only one rope.

110
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.150
He's been down there for quite a while.

111
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.790
Let's not keep him waiting.

112
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.940
I need to hurry.

113
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.670
It is a maintenance rule

114
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.790
that two people can't share one rope.

115
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.250
You must use another one.

116
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120
All right.

117
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.390
Go get one, then.

118
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.890
I'll be here waiting.

119
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.460
Go.

120
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.890
Take it easy.

121
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.620
No running.

122
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.870
I have checked everything.

123
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.600
It's all good here.

124
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.030
Maybe it's the part that connects
to the main cabinet.

125
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.960
Let's get up there.

126
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.440
OK.

127
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.910
Be careful. It's slippery here.

128
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.940
Yeah.

129
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.000
(When I got back there,)

130
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.670
(Lei Zhicheng and Yang Weining
had finished the inspection,)

131
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.960
(and they were ascending
using one rope.)

132
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.670
(Yang Weining was on the top,)

133
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.620
(and Lei Zhicheng was under him.)

134
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.890
(I knew)

135
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.050
(that)

136
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.700
(I would not have another chance.)

137
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.580
(So)

138
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.620
(I took out the hacksaw.)

139
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.790
(I did it calmly,)

140
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.010
(without feeling anything.)

141
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.720
(I had found)

142
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.440
(a goal to which I could devote myself.)

143
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.550
(I didn't care
what price had to be paid,)

144
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.170
(either by me or by others.)

145
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.620
(And I knew that)

146
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.250
(the entire human race)

147
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.790
(would pay an unprecedented price)

148
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:54.130
(for the goal.)

149
00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:01.050
(That was only the beginning.)

150
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:08.940
(I heard two or three surprised cries,)

151
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.890
(and then the sound
of bodies slamming against the rocks.)

152
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.860
(After a while,)

153
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.700
(I saw that the stream
at the foot of the cliff)

154
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.580
(had turned red.)

155
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.460
(Perhaps,)

156
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.670
(the red waters)

157
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.410
(were only my illusion.)

158
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:48.360
(After all, the current of the stream)

159
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.530
(was not as strong as it was
in summer.)

160
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.480
Too many tubes, no?

161
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.530
Well, we need to run a full examination.

162
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.170
- Is your admission procedure finished?
- Yes.

163
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.120
What are you doing here?

164
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.870
I'm here to check you up.

165
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.630
No need. I'm fine.

166
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.910
Just go.

167
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.740
I'm sure you're busy.

168
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:51.260
(Inpatient)

169
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.910
You found Ye Wenxue?

170
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.590
No, I didn't.

171
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.240
I've been in the business
for over twenty years.

172
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.590
I know it is the best way
to deal with people like that.

173
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.880
I knew it.

174
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.590
What about Ye Wenjie?

175
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.510
Has the interrogation begun?

176
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.940
Yes, it began this morning.

177
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.460
What are you doing here then?

178
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.790
Go watch the whole thing.

179
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.250
And you'll repeat everything
to me word by word.

180
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.330
Why are you still sitting here?

181
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.790
Hurry up.

182
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.500
Take Professor Wang back.
He's got a mission.

183
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.640
Professor Wang, don't worry.

184
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.420
I'll take good care of Captain Shi.

185
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:08.380
You let me know at once
when you have the examination report.

186
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.850
Eat the apples.

187
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:53.900
(The Third Affiliated Hospital of Capital
Medical University Examination Report)

188
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.590
Captain Shi, the indicators…

189
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.810
I know.

190
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.460
I understand the numbers.

191
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.310
Wang Miao mustn't see this.

192
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.660
I know him.

193
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.380
Once he knows,
he'll find a place and cry by himself.

194
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.220
Look at you.

195
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.220
I'm not dead yet.

196
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.850
- Give me a cigarette.
- No smoking in the hospital.

197
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.300
(The Third Affiliated Hospital of Capital
Medical University Examination Report)

198
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:42.700
(Respondent: Ye Wenjie)

199
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.570
Professor Ye,
have you regretted it?

200
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.770
No.

201
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.140
Perhaps…

202
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.770
for a small while.

203
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.350
(The deaths of Lei and Yang)

204
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.640
(were treated as accidents.)

205
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.240
(Everybody at the base knew)

206
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.550
(that Yang Weining and I
were a happy couple.)

207
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.590
(So)

208
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.220
(no one suspected me.)

209
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:50.110
(It didn't take long before
a new commissar came to the base.)

210
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:55.330
(And my life returned
to its habitual peace.)

211
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.030
Until one day,

212
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:04.250
Zhang told me
that someone wanted to see me.

213
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.200
Those kids came from
the village of Qijiatun.

214
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.350
They were told
that people were well-educated

215
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.790
here at Radar Peak,

216
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.110
so they would like to ask you some questions
about their study.

217
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.510
Are they even allowed to be here?

218
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.350
Well, the base's security rating
has been reduced.

219
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.720
It'll be fine
as long as they stay outside.

220
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.570
Yesterday, some local villagers came to
bring us vegetables.

221
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.310
Kids, this is Professor Ye
who you asked to see.

222
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.720
Hi. Hello.

223
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.680
Nice to see you, Professor Ye.
Can I ask you a question?

224
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.920
The textbook said that a body in free
fall is under constant acceleration,

225
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.350
but will always reach
a terminal velocity.

226
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:51.090
We've been trying to figure out why
for several nights.

227
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.750
You came all the way up here
just to ask this?

228
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.960
The Exam draws near.

229
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.510
Our teacher told us
that it was an important one.

230
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.470
What exam?

231
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.920
You know,
the National College Entrance Exam.

232
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.480
Whoever studies hard and gets
the best score gets to go the college.

233
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.110
It began two years ago.

234
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.610
Didn't you know?

235
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.030
You don't need
a referral letter anymore?

236
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.010
No. Anybody can take the exam.

237
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:22.480
(More and more kids would come
and ask me more questions.)

238
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.480
(If there was a large group,)

239
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.920
(the leaders at the base would allow)

240
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.440
(me to place a blackboard in my room
to teach the kids.)

241
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.240
Every object will remain at rest
or in uniform motion in a straight line.

242
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:41.160
Inertia varies with mass.

243
00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.240
Do you understand?

244
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.440
Yes.

245
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.550
All right.

246
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.960
We'll end here today.

247
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.510
Today is New Year's Eve.

248
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.750
You'll go home and enjoy the evening.

249
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.750
Professor Ye, my mom invites you to
have dumplings at our home with us.

250
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.000
Professor Ye, my mom also
wants to invite you.

251
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.440
Professor Ye, come to my home.

252
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:11.110
My home. My home.

253
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.270
I appreciate it, but no.

254
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.590
Just go home.

255
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.530
Be careful when you
go down the mountain.

256
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.860
(Wedding Photo, Winter of 1973)

257
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.310
Happy new year, Ye.

258
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.750
What are you doing here
on New Year's Eve?

259
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:11.590
Come on.

260
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.160
Come on. Come here.

261
00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.720
Happy new year, Professor Ye.

262
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.980
What are you doing here?

263
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.790
Come inside.
It's cold out there. Quickly.

264
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.160
Come on. Hurry.

265
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.790
Get inside.

266
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.090
I'm freezing.

267
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.240
It happens that I'm on duty.

268
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.160
Or these kids wouldn't
have found the place.

269
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.830
Ye, I'm still on patrol.

270
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.380
You keep them here.

271
00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.770
Kids, listen to Professor Ye,
don't run about.

272
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.310
Come and get me before you leave,
I'll lead you down the mountain.

273
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.960
Got it?

274
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960
Got it.

275
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.790
All right.

276
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.790
Ye, I'm off.

277
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.770
Thanks.

278
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.510
Come on. Warm yourselves up.

279
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.220
Thank you, Professor Ye.

280
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.050
Do you feel cold?

281
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.980
What is this?

282
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:25.260
Professor Ye, my mom said dumplings
are essential on the New Year's Eve.

283
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.440
We know that you can't
go down the mountain.

284
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.810
So we're here to keep you company.

285
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.810
Thank you.

286
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:50.180
(I thought
it would be a cold New Year's Eve.)

287
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.480
(In June,)

288
00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.290
(I gave birth to Yang Dong.)

289
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:04.310
(Due to malpresentation,
my poor health condition,)

290
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.110
(and the clinic's inability
to deliver a baby at the base,)

291
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.420
(I was taken to the nearest
hospital in town.)

292
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:16.440
(I had a heavy hemorrhage on the way.)

293
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.590
(I was thinking,)

294
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.960
("This probably is it.)

295
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.480
(This is the comeuppance
for my betrayal.")

296
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.140
Everybody, wait outside.

297
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.510
(Operation Room)

298
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.590
It's been ages. She's still in there.

299
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.790
Right. Did something go wrong?

300
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.400
Ye always has a poor health condition.

301
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.880
I don't know.

302
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.770
I hope she's okay.

303
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.380
Is her family here?

304
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.550
How's she doing?

305
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.310
Her family!

306
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.720
She's got no family here.

307
00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.590
Right.

308
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.160
Listen, she had a heavy hemorrhage.
We don't have enough blood.

309
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.480
We need a blood donor.

310
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.010
Me. Me.

311
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.480
We can't just take random blood.
Your blood type needs to match hers.

312
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.880
(Later, the doctor told me)

313
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.640
(that I lost over 2,000 cc of blood.)

314
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.750
(The villagers in Qijiatun
donated their blood)

315
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.460
(to sustain my life.)

316
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.000
I tutored some of their kids,

317
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.880
but most of them, I never met before.

318
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.750
They had only heard about me

319
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.290
from their children or parents.

320
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.420
If it weren't for them,

321
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.530
I would have been dead.

322
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.680
(Yang Dong was born,
but I was too weak)

323
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.550
(to take care of the baby.)

324
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.270
(One villager from Qijiatun
went to talk to the leaders at the base)

325
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.110
(and proposed
to look after me and my baby)

326
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.440
(in his own house.)

327
00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.550
Qi.

328
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.440
Qi.

329
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.330
How is Professor Ye doing?

330
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.720
Don't get in there, you.

331
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.240
But I… Can you keep it down?

332
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.750
You're too loud.

333
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.480
You are disturbing the kid.

334
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.750
My sister-in-law has a relative
in the city.

335
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.960
(Malted milk powder)
She gave me these.

336
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.750
They are supposed to be nutritious.

337
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.830
I figure Professor Ye
will be needing nutrition at the moment.

338
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.180
I'll hand these to her.

339
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.790
Just leave them here.

340
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.510
See all those things?

341
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.310
You know Professor Ye's students?

342
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.570
Their parents bring food here every day.

343
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.790
The leader said this.

344
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.960
He said, "Professor Ye can

345
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.160
return to the base
after she gets better."

346
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.880
But she has to keep herself busy.

347
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.960
She said she'd teach the kids
right in this yard.

348
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.510
Right here? That's good, isn't it?

349
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.240
Hey, you!

350
00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.350
Keep it down.

351
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.830
I mean, look at her.

352
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.030
Quickly, quickly.

353
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.240
Where were you, Feng?

354
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.440
What took you so long?
The kid is crying.

355
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.070
My in-law had to see the baby.

356
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.000
I was so anxious.

357
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.400
All right. All right.
Just make it quick.

358
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.590
Hurry. Hurry.

359
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.240
Quickly.

360
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.660
- All right. All right.
- Hurry. Hurry.

361
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.400
Qi.

362
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.250
- You'll be fed, baby girl.
- Qi.

363
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.500
You can't follow us in.

364
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.190
What is Feng doing here?

365
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.350
Professor Ye can't produce any milk.

366
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.640
Feng is a strong girl,
and she just gave birth.

367
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.790
She's full of milk.

368
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.590
So I got her back.

369
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.980
She can feed two babies, can't she?

370
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.440
Many women fed Dong.

371
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.640
Everybody in the village
was fond of her.

372
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.350
They said my girl looked smart.

373
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:55.790
Gradually, the house became
the gathering place for the villagers.

374
00:30:55.790 --> 00:31:01.180
Old and young,
they all liked to come here.

375
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.030
- He can't look like that.
- She's asleep.

376
00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:04.960
Hurry.

377
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.750
Let me hold her.

378
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.310
It's fine. Go get some rest.
I'll go.

379
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.440
Sister, listen to me.
No, no. She can do that.

380
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.160
You were up all night.

381
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.640
Comrades, I think I'm doing very well.

382
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.720
Is this…

383
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.920
Is this okay?

384
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.510
So?

385
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.960
You like him, don't you?

386
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.590
Is he your type?

387
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.480
No.

388
00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.110
What?

389
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.720
No.

390
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.440
Right?

391
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.090
We're better than that.

392
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.960
No, no, no. Don't do that.

393
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.000
(That piece of memory)

394
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.100
(doesn't even feel like my own.)

395
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.960
More. More.

396
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.000
(It felt more like
the fragments of someone else's life)

397
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.880
(barged into mine.)

398
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.010
Let me see.

399
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.000
What is that, a tail?

400
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.300
One more.

401
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.770
This, this is how you do it. Like this.

402
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.720
(What's the most unforgettable
is those nights I spent with Feng.)

403
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.640
(Qijiatun had no electricity,)

404
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.130
(we would sit next to the oil lamp
to look after the baby.)

405
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.180
I feel cold.

406
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.700
What's on your mind?

407
00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.720
Nothing.

408
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.680
These days

409
00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.400
feel like a dream to me.

410
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.680
It doesn't even belong to me.

411
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.960
What are you talking about?

412
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.960
All right, I need to add more wood
to heat up the bed.

413
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.700
I'll help, so you don't have to
go in and out twice.

414
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.610
Look at the bright stars.

415
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.110
Wenjie,

416
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:46.940
how come the stars
don't fall from the sky?

417
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.350
Are you afraid that they will fall?

418
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.550
I'm not.

419
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.010
They are so small.

420
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.810
They are very far away from us.

421
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.700
They won't fall.

422
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.920
All right, back to the wood-burning.
Get back into the room.

423
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.440
It is cold outside.

424
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.730
Get inside.

425
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.420
(That was a brief)

426
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.380
happy moment.

427
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.710
But you lived through the worst time.

428
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.360
Two years after your daughter was born,

429
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.000
you and your father
were politically rehabilitated.

430
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.140
Yes.

431
00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.670
I received a letter from my college.

432
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.480
They said I could return to work.

433
00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.480
A sum of money came with the letter.

434
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.300
That was the back pay owed to my father

435
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.210
after his rehabilitation.

436
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.500
At base meetings,

437
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.630
they finally

438
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.530
addressed me as Comrade Ye Wenjie.

439
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.590
At the time,

440
00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.820
I remembered the letter

441
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.150
that I sent to Trisolaris

442
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.130
two years ago.

443
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.230
But I was very aware

444
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:35.420
that they'd never see me
as their comrade again.

445
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:38.710
Until you left the base,

446
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:43.190
you never received anything
from Trisolaris ever again?

447
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.800
It would take at least eight years

448
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.110
to receive the reply from Trisolaris.

449
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.480
And after I left the base,

450
00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.150
I no longer had any way
to receive replies.

451
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.030
How did you cope after you went back?

452
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.190
After all, the time had changed.

453
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.270
Right.

454
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.880
Everybody had changed.

455
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.550
They started to
take technology seriously.

456
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.670
They started to approach science,

457
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.760
believe in the good qualities
of being hard-working

458
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.480
and down-to-earth.

459
00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.840
At the first National Conference
on Science,

460
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.550
Guo Moruo declared
that it was the season

461
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.540
of rebirth and renewal
for China's battered science establishment.

462
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.400
At the time,

463
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.380
I would often ask myself,

464
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.960
"Is this the end

465
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.800
of the madness?

466
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.280
Is science and rationality

467
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.300
really coming back?"

468
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.980
As time went by,

469
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.460
the Red Coast Base

470
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.700
started to feel surreal to me.

471
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.550
(That thing was too important.)

472
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.440
(And I had done it all by myself.)

473
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.670
(It felt more and more
like my hallucination.)

474
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.110
(Like a dream.)

475
00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:15.590
(Could the sun really
amplify radio signals?)

476
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:19.710
(Did I really use the sun as an antenna)

477
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.480
(to send a message into the universe)

478
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.870
(about human civilization?)

479
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:32.690
(Did I really receive a message
from an alien civilization?)

480
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.710
(Also, Lei Zhicheng,)

481
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.630
(and Yang Weining.)

482
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.460
(Did I really…)

483
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.900
But that was real.

484
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.590
I started to have doubt

485
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.690
about the super betrayal.

486
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.070
I tried to numb myself with work

487
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:06.630
in order to forget the past.

488
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.500
It made me

489
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.780
feel safe.

490
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.400
Professor Ye,

491
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.380
could you really forget that?

492
00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.670
It was difficult.

493
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.710
I tried to sympathize with
those who once harmed me.

494
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.070
I thought benevolence

495
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:31.050
might be helpful.

496
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.650
I hoped

497
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.670
that they, too,

498
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.610
could move on.

499
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.630
You mentioned people who harmed you.

500
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.340
Who were they?

501
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.480
My mother.

502
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.780
Shao Lin.

503
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.210
And the one who led

504
00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.130
the interrogation

505
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.050
on my father.

506
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.230
After my father passed away,
my mother soon recovered

507
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.320
from her mental breakdown

508
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.860
and found ways

509
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.820
to survive through the hardships.

510
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.000
(In 1977,)

511
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.880
(she married)

512
00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.030
(a dismissed high-level cadre
from the Ministry of Education.)

513
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.440
(She correctly foresaw the future)

514
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.150
(and made the right choice.)

515
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.920
(Before the end of the revolution,)

516
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.340
(her husband was partially
restored to his old position.)

517
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.230
(After the Third Plenary Session
of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee,)

518
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.800
(he was promoted rapidly.)

519
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.360
(Shao Lin left her old college,)

520
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.280
(and was promoted to be the vice president
of another famous university.)

521
00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.670
What?

522
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.000
Put it here.

523
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.710
No eggplant tonight.

524
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.550
Wenjie doesn't like that.

525
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.960
Cook a fish.

526
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.030
It's good for the children.
Want a candy?

527
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.940
I'll remove the package for you.

528
00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.110
♪Oh, the sea♪

529
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.590
She's such a good girl.

530
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:22.670
♪It's just like our mother♪

531
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:27.650
I'm sure you went through
a lot of sufferings.

532
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.610
How did you cope with them?

533
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.050
Here, Grandma's got it.
Grandma's got it.

534
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:43.690
Welcome home.

535
00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:58.160
♪Mother used to tell me♪

536
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.180
♪That I'm from the sea♪

537
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:13.150
♪I was born by the sea,
raised in the sea♪

538
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.090
Is everything okay at work?

539
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.950
That's alright.

540
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:23.360
The teachers are mostly Father's
former students and co-workers.

541
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.170
They are nice to me.

542
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.840
I don't want it.

543
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.030
OK.

544
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.630
I bought some new clothes for you.

545
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.030
Would you like to have a look?

546
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:40.360
I want this one.

547
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.190
OK.

548
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.710
Take the candy with you, all right?

549
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.800
Good girl.

550
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.750
All of them.

551
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.850

554
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.960
After the dinner,

555
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.000
her husband walked us a long distance.

556
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.480
You're welcome to come home with
your daughter more often.

557
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:17.760
But remember, do not try to pursue
old historical debts.

558
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760
Your mother bears no responsibility
for your father's death.

559
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.820
She, too, was a victim.

560
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.630
Whereas your father

561
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:33.710
clung to his own faith

562
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.310
in a manner that was not healthy

563
00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.760
and walked all the way
down a blind alley.

564
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.590
He abandoned his responsibility
to his family

565
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:45.730
and caused you
and your mother to suffer.

566
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.660
You have no right to speak of my father.

567
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.210
It is between me and my mother.

568
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.610
It has nothing to do with you.

569
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.050
Well, you're right.

570
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:10.380

on a message from your mother.
