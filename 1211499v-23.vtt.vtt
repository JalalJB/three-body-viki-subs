What extent had she traced to?

10
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.220
She tracked down Tsinghua University

11
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.350
before she died.

12
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.570
Yes.

13
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.620
That's the university
Ye Wenjie works in.

14
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.230
Professor Ye.

15
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.790
Actually, we investigated
Chen Xue before

16
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.190
because she was
the daughter of Ye's sister

17
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.150
and lived on one floor above Ye's home.

18
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.930
You know her sister, don't you?

19
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.000
She is Ye Wenxue who took the lead
in exposing their father, Ye Zhetai.

20
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.310
Chen Xue was a top student in her class

21
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.750
and joined Tsinghua University's
independent enrollment,

22
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.580
becoming the only student
recommended for direct admission.

23
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.560
But she didn't receive
the admission notice

24
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680
because the person
ranked No. 2 went to Ye Wenxue

25
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.550
and paid an amount of money
to buy the admission.

26
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.780
Therefore, Ye Wenxue secretly withdrew
Chen Xue's college application.

27
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.380
(Regard me as nonexistent.)

28
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.620
Are you Chen Xue?

29
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.060
I am teaching astrophysics
in Tsinghua University.

30
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.690
Has your mother told you

31
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.370
that she has a sister?

32
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.910
And then Chen Xue went to study at MIT

33
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.080
and returned to China
in June as a graduate student.

34
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.350
The course of her life looks normal,

35
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.430
so if it weren't because of
the two homicide cases,

36
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.590
we would never have noticed her.

37
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.310
All clues point to one person.

38
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.910
I know.

39
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.410
Ye Wenjie.

40
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.980
I admit there are many
doubtful points on her,

41
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.270
but there is only one thing

42
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.950
that has been perplexing
and confusing me.

43
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.120
Yang Dong was her daughter.

44
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.920
Why does it perplex you?

45
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.630
Why?

46
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.270
How could you be confused by that?

47
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.800
There is nothing to be confused about!

48
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.480
The enemy we're facing now
is not a human

49
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.560
but the ETO, the extraterrestrials!

50
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.430
Can you figure it out
by a human's logic?

51
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.430
I know you have a strong empathy
and like to empathize with everything.

52
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.750
But let me tell you, Wang Miao.

53
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.830
When you try to
empathize with your enemy,

54
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.660
your judgement of right and wrong
has been overturned. Do you understand?

55
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.370
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.070
The reason why I said these words is that
you're going to attend the ETO's meet-up.

57
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.220
By then, you will face
a more complex situation than we expect.

58
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.830
If your judgment
is still affected by your feelings,

59
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.270
your kindness will be used,

60
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.450
and you'll be put into
a more dangerous situation.

61
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.690
I see.

62
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.370
But I have you, right?

63
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.740
You're affected by Pan Han.

64
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.930
Yes.

65
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.870
But since he
made Mu Xing a scapegoat,

66
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.450
she would have posed a threat to you
if I hadn't dealt with her.

67
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.800
Our comrades can't be our enemies.

68
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.240
The reason why
I agreed to let Evans form the ETO

69
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.830
and be the commander

70
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.250
was that I hoped they could be
guided to be on the right road

71
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.930
instead of the anti-human one.

72
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.120
We shouldn't give up easily.

73
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.070
But they've launched the war to us.

74
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.430
Commander,
the conference is going to begin soon,

75
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.870
and we're waiting for you
to send out the confirmation document

76
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.220
as well as your final command.

77
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.060
It's confirmed.

78
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.220
Send it out.

79
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.720
The former party of net citizens
was used to select members,

80
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.270
so the attendees of this meeting
must be from the ETO.

81
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.000
We just helped the Adventists
to deal with the Redemptionists,

82
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.390
and they're going to hold a conference?

83
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.560
They must have
something important to discuss,

84
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.000
and core members are likely to appear.

85
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.690
I suggest setting up a full deployment
so that we may catch some of them.

86
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.190
The ETO is not a normal criminal group,

87
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.950
and there may be
armed forces on the scene.

88
00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:00.100

give me enough manpower this time.

The reason why the Adventists

154

is that in the midst of us exist

What has the Environment Branch done
under your leadership?

161
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.790
Your responsibility is to exploit and
create environmental problems

162
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.880

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.400
to gain reputations
and interests for yourself.

165
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.000
I've never gained
reputations for myself.

166
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.830
In my eyes,
humans are a pile of trash.

167
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.830
I don't care about reputations,

168
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.350
but I need charisma
to channel people's thinking.

169
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.110
You murdered someone
and have drawn fire against yourself.

170
00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.350
The governments of the world are in the
state of war one after another now.

171
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.350
In Europe and North America,
they're cracking down on the ETO.

172
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.750
Once we come to light,

173
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.310
the Redemptionists will transfer
their allegiance to the government,

174
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.400
so what we should do now

175
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.030
is to purge them from our organization.

176
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.880
That's something
you should not consider.

177
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.920
Yes.

178
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.010
Of course it should be considered
by Commander.

179
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.070
But comrades,

180
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:23.830
I can tell you responsibly
that Commander is an Adventist!

181
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.550
No.

182
00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.790
You're wrong.

183
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.740
Commander is a Redemptionist.

184
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.640
Comrades, don't trust him.

185
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.590
Don't trust him.

186
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.200
He's talking nonsense
and indiscreet in speaking.

187
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.880
We all know Commander's prestige well.

188
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.270
If what you said is true,

189
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.510
the Redemptionists would
have already been purged.

190
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.680
What if Commander
knows something we don't?

191
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.830
Perhaps that's what
the conference today is about.

192
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.960
Comrades, what should we do now?

193
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.880
Global uprising!

194
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.750
Yes.

195
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.750
Global uprising!

196
00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.350
Global uprising! Global uprising!

197
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.960
Global uprising! Global uprising!

198
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.640
Global uprising! Global uprising!

199
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.880
Global uprising!

200
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.110
You're asking for death!

201
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.590
You're asking for death!

202
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.830
You're asking for death!

203
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.640
Long live the spirit of Trisolaris!

204
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.880
We're tough grasses
that resprout after every wildfire!

205
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.200
Revolution can reveal our existence
in the political stage in the world.

206
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.960
It will mark the first public appearance
of the ETO in human race's history.

207
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.880
As long as the agenda is correct,

208
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.350
I believe it will
arouse a wide response in the world.

209
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.110
Yes.

210
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.680
Global uprising! Global uprising!

211
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.440
Global uprising! Global uprising!

212
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.110
Global uprising!

213
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.270
Silence!

214
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.750
Silence!

215
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.380
Commander is here!

216
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.680
Eliminate human tyranny.

217
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.920
The world belongs to Trisolaris!

218
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.290
Hello, comrades.

219
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.330
Sit down.

220
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.070
I've been in poor health recently

221
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.250
and haven't met you much.

222
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.720
The situation is very severe now,

223
00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.110
and I know you're under high pressure.

224
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.790
Commander, take care of yourself.
Commander, please take care of yourself.

225
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.270
- Commander, take care of yourself.
- Before discussing important matters,

226
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.500
let's deal with a small thing.

227
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.510
Pan Han.

228
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.110
Commander, I'm here.

229
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.440
You disobeyed
the organization's rule seriously.

230
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.590
Commander, our organization is facing
a danger of getting swamped.

231
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:32.000
If we don't take decisive measures
to cleanse the traitors and enemies,

232
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.240
we'll lose everything.

233
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.680
The ultimate ideal and goal of the ETO
is to lose everything.

234
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.350
Everything humans have, including us.

235
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:47.110
Commander,
do you still insist on this ideal?

236
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.900
If so, you're an Adventist.

237
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.270
Please openly announce it now.

238
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.850
It means a lot to us.

239
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.740
This request
should haven't been proposed by you.

240
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.510
You've seriously disobeyed
our organization's rule.

241
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.270
If you want to appeal, you can do it now.

242
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.880
Otherwise,
you have to bear the responsibility.

243
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.270
I just asked Wei Cheng and Shen Yufei
to stop calculating,

244
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:22.590
which was decided by Comrade Evans
and approved unanimously in the meeting.

245
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.110
If we solve the Three-Body Problem,
Lord won't come,

246
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.240
and the enterprise of Trisolaris
on the Earth will be ruined.

247
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.110
Let us believe you.

248
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:38.350
After all,
it's not the most important thing now.

249
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.960
I hope we can continue to trust you.

250
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.400
Please repeat
what you requested to me.

251
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.610
I...

252
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.720
Please openly announce
you're an Adventist.

253
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.480
After all, the Adventists' agenda
is also your ideal.

254
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.830
Then repeat the agenda.

255
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.070
Human society can no longer rely on
its own power to solve its problems,

256
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.440
nor can it restrain its madness.

257
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.960
Therefore, we should ask Lord to come,

258
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.590
and in virtue of its power,

259
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.790
supervise and transform
humans by force

260
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.960
to create a bright,
new and advanced civilization.

261
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:30.590
Are the Adventists
loyal to this agenda?

262
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.510
Of course, Commander.

263
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.240
Please don't believe false rumors.

264
00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.070
No.

265
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:40.090
It was not a false rumor.

266
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.380
Who are you?

267
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.440
I am Rafael.

268
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.200
I know you.

269
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.200
You used to devote
to alleviating regional conflicts.

270
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.920
Yes, Commander.

271
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.550
That's me.

272
00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.750
Three years ago,

273
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:05.010
my son died in a car accident.

274
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.000
Immediately after,

275
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.310
I organized the donation of his kidney

276
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.440
to a little girl
from a neighboring country.

277
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.510
I wanted to show my hopes

278
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.920
of a peaceful
coexistence of our two nations.

279
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.270
Many people from revolt sites
supported me.

280
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:31.720
But I was also attacked publicly.

281
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.440
They said I was a traitor
of my own nation.

282
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.000
And on the other side,
they said I was a manipulator.

283
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.720
My home got cut in the middle.

284
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:48.350
We witnessed an endless spiral
of violence and vengeance.

285
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.830
I had dedicated all my life
for the achievement of peace,

286
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.480
but in the end,

287
00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.900
I lost all my faith in humanity.

288
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.330
That was when I decided to join the ETO.

289
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.470
Desperation changed you.

290
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.910
Yes.

291
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:17.530
Desperation turned me from a pacifist

292
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.440
into an extremist.

293
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.200
And I donated so much money
to the Organization

294
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.720
that it became quite easy for me

295
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:32.240
to join the core members
of the Adventists.

296
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.790
And today, as an insider,

297
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.830
I want to reveal to you

298
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.160
the hidden agenda of the Adventists.

299
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.720
The Adventists believe

300
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.550
that humans are an evil species.

301
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:54.550
They think that the human civilization

302
00:26:54.550 --> 00:27:00.550
has committed
unforgivable crimes against the Earth.

303
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:05.050
The final goal of the Adventists

304
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:10.090
is to completely destroy our human down!

305
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.510
The real agenda of the Adventists
has already been an open secret.

306
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.790
Yes.

307
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.960
You're right.

308
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.610
But what you all don't know

309
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:28.090
is that this goal was there

310
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.720
right from the beginning.

311
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.030
It was the life-long dream
of Mike Evans,

312
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.000
the mastermind behind the Adventists.

313
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.270
Evans lied to the Organization.

314
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.440
He fooled everyone,
including our commander.

315
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.480
And he turned the Adventists

316
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.790
into a terror, a kingdom of terror,

317
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.200
in bringing together
extreme environmentalists

318
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.140
and all sorts of madmen
that hated humanity.

319
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.420
I didn't learn

320
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.640
Evans' real thoughts until much later.

321
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.690
Even so,

322
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.750
I still tried to
patch over the differences

323
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.830
to make the ETO

324
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.060
remain united.

325
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.480
However,

326
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.790
some of the other things
done by the Adventists

327
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.960
made my efforts impossible.

328
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.920
Commander,

329
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.030
the Adventists
are the core power of the ETO.

330
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.270
Without us, there would be
no Earth-Trisolaris Movement.

331
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.830
But it's not the reason for you

332
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.550
to monopolize the communication
between the Organization and Lord.

333
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.960
We established
the Second Red Coast Base,

334
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.000
so of course we should operate it.

335
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
That was the condition
the Adventists took advantage of

336
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
to commit an unforgivable
betrayal to the Organization.

337
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.510
You intercepted
Lord's messages to the Organization

338
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:26.510
and passed on only a few of them.

339
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.510
And after distorting,

340
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.640
you sent a lot of messages

341
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.720
that hadn't been
checked by the Organization

342
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.750
to Lord through
the Second Red Coast Base.

343
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.880
There is much evidence

344
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.160
of the Adventists' betrayal.

345
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:46.110
Comrade Shen Yufei
was one of the providers.

346
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:49.350
She used to be one of
the core members of the Adventists,

347
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.310
but in the deepest bottom of her heart,

348
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:56.030
she was a firm Redemptionist.

349
00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.270
You knew that later.

350
00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:04.180
The reason why she died
was that she had known too much.

351
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:10.060
Men like Evans and you

352
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.030
are incurable.

353
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:17.400
In order to maintain
the agenda and ideal of the ETO,

354
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:23.330
we'll completely solve
the problem of the Adventists.

355
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.700
Wang.

356
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.380
Wang.

357
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:25.440
Let me introduce you the academician
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

358
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.270
Professor Wang Miao.

359
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:32.000
He's my friend
and researches nanomaterials,

360
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.330
which is the first technology that Lord
wants to extinguish from the Earth.

361
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.510
Professor Ye, why does Lord want to
extinguish this technology first?

362
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:59.090
It starts from the Red Coast.

363
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:05.470
Many of us have heard about
the story of the Red Coast,

364
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.240
but many don't.

365
00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.440
In this special moment,

366
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.200
it's necessary for me to review

367
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:21.900
our organization's
development and history with you.

368
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:29.770
The story of the Red Coast starts now.

374
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.070

in the monitoring state.)

375

What problem do you meet?

383
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.400
Solar activities
plague a lot to the monitoring,

384
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.460
mainly the solar interference.

What are you looking for?

398
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:33.770
We asked to transfer Wenjie here
because of this report.

399
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:34.926
(Attempted Mathematical Model of the Sun)
We should have already used her,

400
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:35.630
(By Ye Wenjie)
We should have already used her,

401
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.000
but you kept her from dealing
with the problems in this aspect.

402
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.780
Now, Wenjie found it herself.

403
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.570
How much do you know
about the solar interference?

404
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:15.800
The solar interference often appears in
communication satellite technology.

405
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.920
Earth.

406
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.880
Satellite.

407
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.760
Sun.

408
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.590
When they are in a straight line,

409
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.980
and the reception antenna on the surface
of the Earth aims at the satellite,

410
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.000
its background will be the sun.

411
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.760
The sun is a giant source
of electromagnetic radiation,

412
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.400
so the microwave from the satellite

413
00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.990
will be hugely interfered
by solar radiation.

414
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.960
Yes.

415
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.710
But the solar interference
is different in the Red Coast.

416
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.760
Exactly.

417
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.610
The outer space
is a transmission source,

418
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.030
and the Red Coast is a receiver.

419
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.800
The sun, as the interference,
is in between.

420
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.710
Therefore, we'll be interfered
more severely and frequently

421
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.320
than the communication satellites.

422
00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.400
Besides,
the monitoring and transmission systems

423
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.440
share the same antennae,

424
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.280
so the time for monitoring
is compressed immensely.

425
00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.840
Under this circumstance,

426
00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.920
the solar interference
becomes a more serious problem.

427
00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.920
You've mentioned in this essay
that the sun is simply composed

428
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.920
by hydrogen and helium.

429
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.670
Although the physical
process is violent,

430
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.000
it's just a fusion
from hydrogen into helium.

431
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.460
This kind of fusion
could be calculated.

432
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:30.300
You provide us
with a new train of thought.

433
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:32.920
In fact,

434
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.440
Political Commissar Lei and I
simply want to figure out

435
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.630
the rule and characteristics
of solar radiation

436
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:45.030
and filter it digitally
so that we won't be interfered.

437
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.960
You want to build
the mathematical model of the sun

438
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.400
to predict the sun's activities

439
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.000
and avoid the sun outages
from interfering the Red Coast?

440
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.360
But the sun's electromagnetic radiation

441
00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.510
is only stable within
the limited range from NUV to MIR,

442
00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.630
including visible light.

443
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.190
In other ranges,
it's volatile and unpredictable.

444
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.800
Therefore, during the periods
of intense solar activities,

445
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.480
such as sunspots, solar flares,
coronal mass ejections,

446
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.940
the solar interference
can't be eliminated.

447
00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.840
Okay.

448
00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.360
Well,
let's put the special situation aside,

449
00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.230
and just study the radio outbursts
in the sun's normal activities.

450
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.340
How is it?

451
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.000
Weining and I are professional,

452
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.110
but I focus on mental work,

453
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:42.650
and Weining doesn't study astrophysics,
so we can't develop much in our major.

454
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:50.050
That's why we leave this problem to you.

455
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.590
You can tell me
whatever problem you meet

456
00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.440
in the process.

457
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.260
I'll try my best to solve it.

458
00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:48.170
(I researched for half a year,
and the process was very slow.)

459
00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.440
(In other words,
I saw no glimpse of hope.)

460
00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.550
(In the monitoring scope
of the Red Coast,)

461
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.480
(solar radiation was unpredictable.)

462
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.280
(There were many phenomena)

463
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.420
(that I couldn't explain
depending on my knowledge at that time.)

464
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.360
(My research was at a standstill,)

465
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.010
(and I couldn't find a way.)

466
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.940
What problem do you have?

467
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.960
I couldn't figure it out
or find an explanation for it.

468
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.320
Normally, if solar radiation
has a sudden fluctuation,

469
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:50.210
there will be violent activities
on the sun's surface.

470
00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.440
It's just like this.

471
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.000
When the surface of water waves,

472
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.420
there must be wind blowing or

473
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.730
a stone throwing into it.

474
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.190
But over thousands of observed data

475
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.030
show that when
a frequency range has a fluctuation,

476
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.590
the surface activities of the sun
are as calm as usual.

477
00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:22.840
Do you mean
that the surface of the water waves

478
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.230
without being blown by the wind
or thrown into stones?

479
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.980
And it's a violent fluctuation.

480
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.650
Could this kind of radiation come from
the sun's core?

481
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:43.000
The shortwave and microwave radiation

482
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.530
can't pierce through hundreds of thousands of
kilometers from the sun's core to its surface.

483
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:55.440
So it means this situation could
only happen on the sun's surface.

484
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.630
According to the present
materials of the sun I have,

485
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.480
this seems to be the only possibility.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.420
(to the narrow frequency ranges?)
