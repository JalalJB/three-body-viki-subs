=Episode 29=

3
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.120
The existing nanomaterials...
If this plan is followed,

4
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.780
the distance between the two filaments
should be at least 50 centimeters.

5
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.120
That is to say, the ship
has to cross the canal during the day.

6
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.510
Why exactly?

7
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.000
People on board have to sleep at night.

8
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.960
(When a person is lying down,
the gap of 50 centimeters is too much.)

9
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.800
(No matter whether he is standing,
squatting, or sitting during the day,)

10
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.690
(the distance)

11
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.860
is enough.

12
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.690
You are indeed a devil.

13
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.710
I have a question.

14
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.960
50 super-strength nanowires
of 160 meters

15
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.470
are connected to two steel columns
with 50 centimeters apart.

16
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.280
How do we ensure
the safety of other ships?

17
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.800
So I suggest that
each nanowire

18
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.360
is connected to a piece of
ordinary steel wire on the shore.

19
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.080
(One end of each column
is connected to a movable winch.)

20
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.080
(In this way, the nanowires can sink
to the bottom of the river)

21
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.750
(through the weight falling on it.)

22
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.120
(When the last ship passes
before Judgment Day,)

23
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520
(we should retrieve the wire.)

24
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.240
(Then we connect and fix
the nanowires to the pillars,)

25
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.080
(and finally erect the pillars.)

26
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.590
Yeah.

27
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.000
Good.

28
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.470
It sounds...

29
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.520
This should be the best solution so far.

30
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.900
Good idea.

31
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.250
Officer.

32
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.430
The best Havanas.

33
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.060
All yours.

34
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.860
Thank you.

35
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.190
Well.

36
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.750
How long will it take for Judgment Day

37
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.560
to pass through the Gaillard Channel?

38
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.120
According to our calculations,
if Judgment Day

39
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.860
travels at the current speed,
it will take about 96 hours.

40
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.700
This is our preparation time.

41
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.470
Everyone.

42
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.590
It's time for humanity
to help each other.

43
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.680
Now let me assign
the next step of action.

44
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.520
First of all, if there is no doubt,
the Asian Combat Zone,

45
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.190
as the commander-in-chief
of this operation,

46
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.250
will conduct a comprehensive dispatch.

47
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.600
(The European Combat Zone
is mainly responsible

48
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.420
(for engineering construction
on both sides of the Gaillard Channel.)

49
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.950
(After the operation is completed,
the Global Joint Operations Center)

50
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.860
(is responsible for the search work.)

51
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.620
(The front line
will be commanded by Colonel Stanton.)

52
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.160
(The Oceanian Combat Zone
is mainly responsible for the aftermath,)

53
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.160
(including the passage of ships
in the later stage,)

54
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.160
(disaster prevention and rescue, and
the migration of ordinary people, etc.,)

55
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.950
(to ensure that the normal life
of the people around the Panama Canal)

56
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.060
(will not be affected.)

57
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.270
(Professor Wang.)

58
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.190
(You and your Nanomaterial Center
will be solely responsible for)

59
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.120
(the technical support of this operation.)

60
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.220
We named this operation
Operation Zither (Guzheng).

61
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.070
I hereby declare that
Operation Zither

62
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.860
has officially started.

63
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.820
Colonel.

64
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.630
Welcome.

65
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.770
Nice to see you again.

66
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.830
So where's your partner Mr. Shi?

67
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.390
Not coming?

68
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.740
General Chang said that
they need him more.

69
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.070
My partner said that this is for you.

70
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.480
Chinese flavor.

71
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.830
Thank him for me.

72
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.100
You are welcome.

73
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.430
Magnificent, isn't it?

74
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.620
They are executing your plan.

75
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.040
For all these days, I have a question.

76
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.830
This operation
will affect the innocent?

77
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.560
The crew on Judgment Day...

78
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.750
they might know nothing
about the ship.

79
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.510
We've done a series of investigation
on the crew.

80
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.100
The result is rather surprising.

81
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.180
So

82
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.510
they are the worst criminals
in the world.

83
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.790
Terrorists, serial murderers, pirates, murderers

84
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.690
and including an old friend.

85
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.950
Old friend?

86
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.240
I commanded an anti-terrorism
when I was in Marines.

87
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.360
We got a dozen of them.

88
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.040
Enzo was one of them.

89
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.660
He escaped prison and off he went.

90
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.060
He stalked around my home for a month.

91
00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.500
When my wife was out,

92
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.720
he killed my youngest son.

93
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.650
He slit him from throat to belly,
and hung him on the front gate.

94
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.860
He left a note,
said it was for my salvation.

95
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.500
He was seven years old.

96
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.650
Only seven years old.

97
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.600
Sorry.

98
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.170
Do you have any children?

99
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.320
Yes.

100
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.170
A girl of seven.

101
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.600
I bet she's cute and smart.

102
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.480
I don't know how and why the ETO
brought together these criminal crew.

103
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.030
But without a doubt,
it's the devil's cage.

104
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:30.250
What a pity I can't look at him in the eye
as we take the ship out.

105
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.390
Why did you kill him?

106
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.670
Because I love the feeling of my knife

107
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.440
slitting in someone's throat
and cutting him up bit by bit.

108
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.320
Of course this requires a sharp knife.

109
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.840
I'm asking you.

110
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.240
Why did you kill him?

111
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.480
He wanted to go ashore
and that would have exposed us.

112
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.870
We've already had the permission
to enter the canal.

113
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.080
I want to say this again.
He was going to expose us.

114
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.670
I have been serving here
to keep us all alive.

115
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.240
Tell me.

116
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.740
Do you want to die?

117
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.240
Besides, it's been quite long up here.

118
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.740
And it's about time to have some meat.

119
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.580
His death is for your salvation.

120
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.440
The Atlantic and Pacific.

121
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.840
The two great oceans meet
at the Gaillard Channel.

122
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.080
What a magnificent display
of human intelligence.

123
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.870
Let's not get too cocky.

124
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.080
Human intelligence is exactly
what's been threatened.

125
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.150
Judgment Day is under our surveillance.

126
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.500
Okay.

127
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.600
Sir.

128
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.670
Everybody is going crazy,
killing each other every day.

129
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.560
I saw them throw the corpses

130
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.900
of the comrades overboard into the sea,

131
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.200
like they were trash.

132
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.670
This is human.

133
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.870
These people, they don't deserve
to be serving on the Judgment Day.

134
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.550
That's what human nature is.

135
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.130
You should have known this very well.

136
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.440
Think about it,

137
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.510
what's the difference between
you and them in essence?

138
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.460
That's what human nature is.

139
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.840
(Monitoring group, how is the channel?)

140
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.200
(There is a cargo ship
going through the channel.)

141
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.150
(Where is the Judgment Day?)

142
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.150
(Expected to enter the channel
around two hours.)

143
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.440
(Operation Guzheng is about to start.)

144
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.840
Professor.

145
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.710
Have you been to
the Panama Canal before?

146
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.360
No.

147
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.910
I was there in 1990.

148
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:48.290
But it was
the most unimpressive experience for me,

149
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.720
(except for playing Jackson's rock song.)

150
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.770
(Nowhere to Run
in front of the embassy.)

151
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.370

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.010
♪Big broad rivers♪

166
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.390
♪Have no rules♪

167
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.610
♪Big broad rivers♪

168
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.630
♪Have nothing true♪

169
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.510
The name of this operation

170
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.480
is Guzheng.

171
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480
Is it an instrument?

172
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.720
Yes.

173
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.510
It's a Chinese traditional instrument.

174
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.010
(Confirm everything is in order.)

175
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.440
(The zither is ready for sinking.)

176
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.890
What does it look like?

177
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.940
It's...

178
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.910
(a rectangular wooden base,
with many strings and pillars.)

179
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.200
(One pillar for one note.)

180
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.000
(The zither is sinking.)

181
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Operation Guzheng.

182
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.600
An apt description.

183
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.150
(The zither is set.)

184
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.910
(Confirm.)

185
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.150
(Everything is in order.)

186
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.200
(A cruiser is passing the zither.)

187
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.240
(Repeat.)

188
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.000
(A cruiser is passing the zither.)

189
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.960
(Repeat.)

190
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.050
(A cruiser is passing the zither.)

191
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.120
(All ships have left
the operation area.)

192
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.740
(There is no more ship
in front of the target.)

193
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.150
Raise the zither.

194
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.700
(Raise the zither.)

195
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.080
Don't worry, professor.

196
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.700
They know what they are doing.

197
00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.240
Your nano Flying Blades
are really miraculous.

198
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.630
Looks like nothing's there.

199
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.270
But there is a deadly trap in place.

200
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:22.220
(The target has got four kilometers.)

201
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.080
The second time I came to Panama
was in 1999.

202
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.290
(For the handover
of the canal for Panama.)

203
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.080
(Oddly,
when we got to the authority building,)

204
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.480
(the stars-and-strikes
was already down.)

205
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.200
(Seemed the US government had requested)

206
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.150
(the flag to be lowered the day before)

207
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.120
(to avoid the embarrassment
in front of the people.)

208
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.600
Back then I thought
I was witnessing history.

209
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.360
But now it's just a drop in the ocean.

210
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.250
(The target is three kilometers
from the zither.)

211
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.980
Judgment Day will appear there.

212
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.920
(Ever since I knew the spaceship
was coming,)

213
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.720
(it's like I have had amnesia.)

214
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.750
(I can't remember
the things from the past.)

215
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.870
(All the wars I've been in,)

216
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.790
(everything I've done
seems so insignificant.)

217
00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.680
Yes.

218
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.030
Insignificant.

219
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.510
(The target is two kilometers
from the zither.)

220
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.070
After becoming aware of this,

221
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.700
every single human being
became something different.

222
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.590
(Imagine if thousands of years ago,)

223
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:18.660
(we had known that the alien plate
was going to arrive,)

224
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.640
(what would become of the civilization?)

225
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.660
Professor, can you imagine?

226
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.200
No, I can't.

227
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.880
(The target is 1.5 kilometers
from the zither.)

228
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.480
Professor.

229
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.110
I think you're gonna be
the Gaillard of the new era.

230
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.310
We're looking forward
to your canal being built.

231
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.070
I can't design a canal.

232
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.920
The space elevator is a canal.

233
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.590
Just as this canal
connects two oceans,

234
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.220
your canal
will connect the Earth and the space.

235
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:58.290
(The target is one kilometer
from the zither.)

236
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.810
It's here.

237
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.350
Look.

238
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.310
This is the current speed
of Judgment Day.

239
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.400
It will soon enter the Gaillard Channel
from Gatun Lake.

240
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.330
(The target is 700 meters
from the zither.)

241
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.180
(The target is 700 meters
from the zither.)

242
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:45.290
The end of Gaillard Channel.

243
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:52.500
(Ready for the 20-second countdown.)

244
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.960
Professor.

245
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.200
Don't worry.

246
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.050
It's gonna be okay.

247
00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.500
(Countdown begins.)

248
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.920
(Twenty.)

249
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.070
(Nineteen.)

250
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.240
(Eighteen.)

251
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.530
(Seventeen.)

252
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.400
(Ten.)

253
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.750
(Nine.)

254
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.000
(Eight.)

255
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.050
(Seven.)

256
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.830
(Three.)

257
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.000
(Two.)

258
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
(One.)

259
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.250
(It's passing the zither.)

260
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.700
What the...

261
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.090
What's going on?

262
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.550
(Operation Guzheng is completed.)

263
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.770
(Judgment Day has been cut.)

264
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.200
(There is fire on the ship.)

265
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.200
(The Oceanian Combat Zone
has already started the afterwork.)

266
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.160
(Waiting for Colonel Stanton's order.)

267
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.050
(We'll start searching for
Trisolaran civilization info.)

268
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.810
Professor Wang.

269
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:12.740
One day I want to hear
a real Guzheng performance.

270
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.570
Proceed.

271
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.900
Go. Go. Go.

272
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.900
Go. Go. Go.

273
00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.030
Go. Go. Go.

274
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.220
Put yourselves together, boys.

275
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.180
Move.

276
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.250
Come on. Come on.
Put yourselves together, boys.

277
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:57.010
- Find the hard drive.
- Where is the target?

278
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.940
Do you know Trisolaran Civilization?

279
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.460
No.

280
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.840
We have

281
00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.230
very limited information.

282
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.550
In fact, apart from Evans,

283
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:29.190
none of the core members of the Adventists

284
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.670
who intercepted
the Trisolaran information

285
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.590
knew the true and detailed appearance
of the Trisolaran Civilization.

286
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.030
Then why do you have such expectations
for the Trisolarans?

287
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:46.800
Do you think they can transform
and improve human society?

288
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.190
If they can come to our world

289
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:55.460
across the stars,

290
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.360
it means that their science

291
00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.480
has developed to a considerable height.

292
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:07.480
A society with such a prosperous science

293
00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.760
must have a higher level of civilization
and morality.

294
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.900
Do you think your conclusion
is scientific?

295
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.190
Professor Ye.

296
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:26.000
We have obtained all the information
about the Trisolarans

297
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.980
intercepted by the Adventists.

298
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.360
How is

299
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.710
Evans?

300
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.980
Dead.

301
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.550
Is there a lot of information?

302
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.880
Yes.

303
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.940
About 28 GB.

304
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.250
No way.

305
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:56.100
The efficiency of interstellar
ultra-long-distance communication is very low.

306
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.920
How is it possible to convey such a large
amount of information?

307
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.400
I thought so too at first.

308
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.470
But the truth

309
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.000
is beyond our imagination.

310
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.650
Do you know the Three-Body game?

311
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.800
There is a game client in the 28 GB,

312
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.480
just like the game
on the server we shut down earlier.

313
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.150
They are all produced by the ETO

314
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.090
based on human imagination.

315
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.650
I heard that the file doesn't even record
what Trisolarans look like.

316
00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.940
General Chang.

317
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.980
I have a request.

318
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.440
Did everyone of
the Battle Command Center go in?

319
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.480
Yes.

320
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.510
Chang wants scientists like you
to go in and have fun.

321
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:55.860
Perhaps there will be more discoveries.

322
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.440
If we win this war against Trisolarans,

323
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.630
you will be a hero, a veritable hero.

324
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.530
A hero who plays the game?

325
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.280
I used to think that playing games

326
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.630
was not a serious business.

327
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.550
Enough.

328
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.360
As usual. Meet up as soon as we get in.

329
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.260
Okay.

330
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.960
There are many monitoring
and transmitting devices here.

331
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.590
It should be the astronomical observatory
of Trisolaran.

332
00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.030
But operating such an observatory
requires dozens of people.

333
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:02.710
Why is there no one here?

334
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.960
Did the Chaotic Era
suddenly occur again,

335
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.550
and everyone is already dehydrated?

336
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.150
All the materials used
in the Listening Post

337
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.190
are constant temperature materials,

338
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.760
which can ensure the supply of life
and don't need to be dehydrated.

339
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.510
And it's been hundreds of years

340
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.130
since dozens of people
ran a listening post.

341
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.030
Is this a Trisolaran?

342
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.960
This should be the Trisolaran
in ETO's imagination.

343
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.400
It seems to have a casing.

344
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.190
Yes.

345
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:39.710
They should have speculated it
based on some data.

346
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.920
Are you a monitor?

347
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.760
Yes.

348
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.360
There are thousands of listening posts
like this in Trisolarans' world.

349
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.290
They are attentively listening to

350
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.620
the information of possible
intelligent civilizations in the universe.

351
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.030
Thousands of?

352
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.150
Are there thousands of scientists
like Ye Wenjie here?

353
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:59.070
We are not scientists, just monitors.

354
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:03.710
Monitor is a humble occupation,
totally different from a scientist.

355
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:09.070
We are just watching the monitor screen
and living in the dark.

356
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.550
See the desert outside?

357
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.480
It's desolate and lonely.

358
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.710
Totally unbearable.

359
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:19.820
I really wish
I could turn off this screen.

360
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.590
The recognition degree is ten.

361
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:32.210
It means that the received information
contains a self-interpreting system.

362
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:38.150
(We extend our best wishes to you,
inhabitants of another world.)

363
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.320
(After reading the following message,)

364
00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.400
(you should have a basic
understanding)

365
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.630
(of civilization on Earth.)

366
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.840
(By dint of long toil and creativity,
the human race)

367
00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.920
(has built a splendid civilization,)

368
00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.550
(blossoming with diverse cultures.)

369
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.280
(We're also getting to know
the laws of nature)

370
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.230
(and the development
of human societies.)

371
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.960
I know this message.

372
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.190
It was sent from Earth in 1971.

373
00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.960
It takes four light-years to travel here.

374
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.320
That is now 1975 on the Earth.

375
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.070
Yes.

376
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:11.000
There is a world with only one sun,
always in Stable Era.

377
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.360
Human civilization was born
in that well-seasoned paradise.

378
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.710
It's not a dream.

379
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.590
Is it possible for this message
to be hidden?

380
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.840
Thousands of listening posts
scattered all over the world

381
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.030
have also received this information

382
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.110
that Trisolaran Civilization
has been awaited for eons.

383
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.030
Now the government

384
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.440
will definitely send a message
to that distant world,

385
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.070
tempting them to answer.

386
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.360
The message may have been sent
or maybe not.

387
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.440
If it is the latter,

388
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.510
my humble life
can finally burn once.

389
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.800
This world has received your message.

390
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.360
(I am a pacifist in this world.)

391
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.960
(It is the luck of your civilization)

392
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.000
(that I am the first
to receive your message.)

393
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.480
(I am warning you. Do not answer.)

394
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.030
(Do not answer.)

395
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.440
(There are tens of millions of stars
in your direction.)

396
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.670
(As long as you do not answer,)

397
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:56.760
(this world will not be able to ascertain
the source of your transmission.)

398
00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.840
(But if you do answer,
the source will be located right away.)

399
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.590
(Your planet will be invaded.)

400
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.190
(Your world will be conquered.)

401
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.590
(Do not answer.)

402
00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.400
(Do not answer!)

403
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.070
The launch is complete.

404
00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.670
He should be the monitor
who sent the warning to Earth.

405
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.710
As long as there is no answer,

406
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.150
the position of Earth
cannot be locked by the Trisolaran.

407
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.360
He betrayed Trisolaran.

408
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.780
Why?

409
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.000
The lifespan of Trisolaran is generally

410
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.190
between 700,000
and 800,000 Trisolaran hours.

411
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.840
And I have only
100,000 Trisolaran hours left.

412
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.440
Today the world of Trisolaran does not
require extensive monitoring anymore.

413
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.400
Outdated listening posts like No. 1379
will be eliminated.

414
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.360
I will face the fate of being incinerated
after forced dehydration.

415
00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.070
All I have in my life
is the endless solitude

416
00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.000
in the little space
of the listening post.

417
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.070
Even in my dreams, I don't want to lose
that distant paradise.

418
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.110
For this...

419
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.380
For this, I'm willing to stand trial.

420
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.110
Why are you doing this?

421
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.320
In order not to waste my life.

422
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.630
The warning message you sent out
may cause Trisolaran Civilization

423
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.110
to lose a chance of survival.

424
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.710
But I gave Earth civilization
a chance to survive.

425
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:23.110
What made you think about betrayal?

426
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.710
Today's Trisolaran Civilization
possesses the living space

427
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:32.710
like a very hungry person's
desire for food, strong and endless.

428
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.710
It is absolutely impossible
to share that world with earthmen,

429
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.590
but will only destroy the Earth civilization
without hesitation,

430
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.510
and completely occupy the living space
of that planetary system.

431
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.190
Am I right?

432
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.360
Yes.

433
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.070
There is another reason
to wipe out Earth civilization.

434
00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.840
They are also a warlike race,
so they are way too dangerous.

435
00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:58.920
They will learn technology very quickly
when we coexist in a world with them.

436
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.760
Neither civilization
can survive this way.

437
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.440
The policy we have established is that

438
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.800
after the Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet
occupies the solar system and the Earth,

439
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.710
the earthmen can completely
live as before.

440
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.550
Only one thing is forbidden forever,

441
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.130
procreation.

442
00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.670
That means destruction.

443
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.480
You want to be the savior of the Earth,

444
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:30.800
but you have no sense of responsibility
for your own civilization.

445
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800
Chief.

446
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.030
Please look at our life.

447
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.670
Everything is for the survival
of civilization.

448
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.670
The Trisolaran society
is in extreme tyranny.

449
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.710
There are only two levels of law,

450
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:47.110
the guilty are executed
and the acquitted are released.

451
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:51.920
Everything that
can lead to a fragile spirit is evil.

452
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.550
Literature, art,

453
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.760
and even love cannot be poured out.

454
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.590
Chief.

455
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.920
Does such a life make sense?

456
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.510
The kind of civilization you yearn for
once existed in Trisolaran world.

457
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:12.110
But in the reincarnation
of all Trisolaran Civilizations,

458
00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.320
this kind of civilization is the most fragile
and short-lived.

459
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.360
And if the Trisolaran Civilization
finally occupies that world,

460
00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.880
we can also create that kind of life.

461
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.070
I am a nobody.

462
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:31.550
If I can save a distant and beautiful world
that I fell in love with,

463
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.110
at least my life will not be in vain.

464
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.800
There is no doubt that
you are guilty.

465
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.710
You are the worst criminal among all the
reincarnated civilizations of Trisolaran world.

466
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.360
But there is now
an exception to the law.

467
00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.920
You are free.

468
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.550
Why?

469
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:56.150
Being dehydrated and burned
is a small punishment for you.

470
00:45:56.150 --> 00:46:01.000
(I want you to know that
you will not be able to)

471
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.760
(save the Earth
that holds all your hopes.)

472
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:09.000
(I will let you live
until the day it loses all hope.)

473
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.530
All right. Leave.

474
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.860
(Do not answer)

475
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:46.440
Commander of
the Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet.

476
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.190
I will ask the Council of Archons
to consider my plan.

477
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.920
Set sail immediately
after the Fleet is built,

478
00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.880
and head in that direction.

479
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.000
Chief.

480
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.230
Even directional positioning
can't be very accurate

481
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.900
on that receiving frequency.

482
00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.420
We have to take the risk.
