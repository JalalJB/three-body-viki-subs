We found nothing.

11
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.330
We still don't know what those math guys are doing, right?

12
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.050
They were asked to solve certain problems within the allotted time.

13
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.530
As for what that was for, they had no idea.

14
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.530
Shen Yufei went to such great lengths to help Wei Cheng for her own purpose, I guess.

15
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.140
Couldn't it be for love?

16
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.671
- No one's in. 
 - Let me. I got this.

17
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.530
Maybe we can come again some other time.

18
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.130
Move.

19
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.530
Captain Shi, trespassing isn't allowed.

20
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.560
I'm not breaking in.

21
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.960
I'm trying to make some noise.

Party time.

28
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.650
Let's celebrate.

29
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.230
- Here you go. 
 - Thanks.

30
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.660
It's the variable, not the constant.

31
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.170
I thought it was the constant, but it's the variable.

32
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.240
So, you... Probability.

33
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.560
Yes, probability.

34
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.900
So, you've got the result?

35
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.100
No.

36
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.460
This is only the first step.

37
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.440
How many are they?

38
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.050
More than 100 steps, maybe.

39
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.960
Or more.

40
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.160
Isn't it too soon to celebrate?

41
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.720
Wrong!

42
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920
If you're going in the wrong direction, all those steps will lead you nowhere.

43
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.270
But I'm certain that I am right on track.

44
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.570
And that's worth...

45
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.530
another drink.

46
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.490
What are you calculating anyway?

47
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.420
What is it?

48
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.080
An evolutionary algorithm.

49
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.360
Evolutionary algorithm.

50
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.140
What's that?

51
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.020
Hey, dude, stay with me.

52
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.490
What algorithm?

53
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.090
What's it for?

54
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.410
Wake up.

55
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.410
Let's drink.

56
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.821
Come on, man. Drink with me.

57
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.190
He can't drink.

58
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.530
I... I... I didn't ask him to.

59
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.370
What do you want now, Captain Shi?

60
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.260
Nothing. Just making small talk.

61
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.820
Your husband found the right path.

62
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.400
So, the path to what?

63
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.580
Why do you care?

64
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.970
He's into math.

65
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.210
If he's doing one plus one makes two, would you be interested?

66
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.350
In this world, no one truly understands him.

67
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.960
Math is his one and only passion.

68
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.020
He's got no other hobbies.

69
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.660
To help him with his pursuit, I hired an army to work with him.

70
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.210
I'm so glad that his work has finally come to fruition.

71
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.300
Still, what is he working on?

72
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.560
He can't take in alcohol.

73
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.520
I said it wasn't me.

74
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.610
Captain, Shen Yufei and Wei Cheng don't look like a married couple.

75
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.111
I agree. With her husband on the floor,

76
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:02.800
she picked up the cushion first.

77
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.530
Would you call that place home?

78
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.070
It's filled with piles of used paper, computers, and office supplies.

79
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.780
I'd call it a studio.

80
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.950
They're more employer-employee than husband-wife.

81
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.360
Are all scientists like that?

82
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.820
When Wei Cheng was in high school,

83
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.010
he won first place in the IMO in Budapest and was accepted

84
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.020
by Fudan's math program without taking the entrance exam. 
 <i>[Fudan University Admission Letter]</i>

85
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.080
But he didn't put too much effort into his Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctor's degrees.

86
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.250
After graduation, he didn't have much of a career

87
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.600
and went back to teach at a college.

88
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.050
Yet he couldn't survive there, either.

89
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.410
He was muddling along...

90
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.890
until he met Shen Yufei

91
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.320
and married her soon after.

92
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:09.030
Financially, she provided for him and helped with his calculation.

93
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.000
When you put it like that, love can be ruled out for sure.

94
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.460
Shen Yufei did all that for herself.

95
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.340
Or why would she choose such a loser?

96
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.660
Maybe in her eyes,

97
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.600
he's some sort of a genius.

98
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.320
You mean it's switched into the standby mode.

99
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.540
Yes.

100
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:29.230
A few key parts are still running to store the completed data

101
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.570
and maintain basic operations

102
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.440
to prepare the computer to reenter the compute mode anytime.

103
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.270
Also, that's more economical.

104
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.080
Yes, as it should be.

105
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.590
It's been running for 16 long months.

106
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.080
Your Majesty, the first phase of the computation was complete.

107
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.730
The results precisely described the orbits of the three suns for the next two years.

108
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.180
Tell me about it.

109
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:08.350
My great Emperor, the calculations show that the long night is about to be over.

110
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.750
We'll soon welcome the first sunrise of a long Stable Era.

111
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.750
You mean the sun is about to rise?

112
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.670
Yes.

113
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.240
And this Era will last over a year.

114
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.510
Judging by the orbital parameters, the climate will be mild and comfortable.

115
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.080
Please let your empire be rehydrated!

116
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.100
Rehydrate.

117
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:39.990
In just five seconds, Your Majesty, prepare to receive your glory!

118
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.840
Your Majesty, I'm afraid the calculations were in error.

119
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.620
Disaster is about to befall us!

120
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.120
What are you babbling about?

121
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.440
You, a mere astrologer, are questioning His Majesty's grand computer?

122
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.800
Don't you see that the sun is rising at the exact moment predicted by our precise calculations?

123
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.670
But how many suns do you see?

124
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.240
How many?

125
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.870
Need you ask?

126
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.000
Astrologer, you must at least know how to count.

127
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.720
Of course, there's only one sun.

128
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.270
And the temperature is perfect.

129
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.030
No, Your Majesty.

130
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.440
There are three.

131
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.240
The other two are behind that one!

132
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.230
Are you out of your mind?

133
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.200
The Imperial Observatory has confirmed

134
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:42.210
that the three suns are in a straight line, moving around our planet at the same angular speed!

135
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.870
This is extremely rare!

136
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.480
A Tri-solar Syzygy.

137
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.550
Thus, our planet and the three suns

138
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:58.170
are in a straight line with our world at the end of this line!

139
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.000
Are you sure about this?

140
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.910
Absolutely!

141
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:08.590
The observation was conducted by the Western astronomers of the Imperial Observatory, including Kepler and Herschel.

142
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:14.600
They're using the largest telescope in the world, imported from Europe!

143
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:20.790
My greatest, most honorable Emperor, this is the most propitious sign!

144
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.510
Now that the three suns are orbiting around our planet,

145
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.030
your empire becomes the center of the universe.

146
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.750
This is God's reward for our efforts.

147
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.440
Let me double-check the calculations.

148
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.610
I'll... I'll prove this!

149
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.690
Von Neumann, what do you think about this phenomenon?

150
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:49.240
Your Majesty, it wasn't included in any of the previous calculations.

151
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.880
-. I'll try to... 
 - Report!

152
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.150
What now?

153
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.030
Sir Newton stole a horse and left.

154
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.510
We lost track of him.

155
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.300
What?

156
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.520
That rat! How dare he flee!

157
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.480
He's a good-for-nothing!

158
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.480
A coward, a chicken!

159
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.630
Your Majesty, please unsheathe your sword.

160
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.910
What for?

161
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.970
Please try to swing it.

162
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.260
Why is it so light?

163
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.600
The game's V-suit can't simulate the feeling of diminished gravity.

164
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.930
Otherwise, we'd feel that we're much lighter as well.

165
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.360
Look! Down there!

166
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.960
Look at those men!

167
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.820
And the horses!

168
00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.150
So, what's going on here?

169
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.100
Your Majesty, the three suns are over our planet in a straight line,

170
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.460
so their gravitational forces pare added together...

171
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.120
What's next?

172
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.170
Acceleration?

173
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.370
Are the mountains transparent?

174
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.600
They aren't mountains.

175
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.360
They were formed from the ocean attracted into space.

176
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.840
I figured it out! Electronic elements!

177
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.510
Use them to make gate circuits and combine them into computers!

178
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.830
Such computers will be much faster!

179
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.240
(Tri-solar Syzygy.)

180
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.200
(Because the atmosphere was gone, there was no more sound.)

181
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.540
(I was seeing the other two suns.)

182
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.340
(Civilization No. 184 was destroyed by the stacked gravitational attractions of a Tri-solar Syzygy.)

183
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.670
(This civilization had advanced to the Scientific Revolution and the Industrial Revolution.)

184
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.910
(In this civilization, Newton established nonrelativistic classical mechanics.)

185
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.121
(At the same time, due to the invention of calculus and the Von Neumann architecture computer,)

186
00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:51.510
(the foundation was set for the quantitative mathematical analysis)

187
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.870
(of the motion of three bodies.)

188
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.340
(After a long time, life and civilization will begin again, )

189
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.030
(and progress once more through the unpredictable world of Three-Body.)

190
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.750
(We invite you to log on again.)

191
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.400
Yes?

192
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.201
Hello.

193
00:17:17.201 --> 00:17:19.480
First, thanks for giving us your real number.

194
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm a system administrator for the Three-Body game.

195
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.590
Please tell me your name, education, occupation, and position.

196
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.980
You left them blank during registration.

197
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.240
What do they have to do with the game?

198
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.440
Now that you've reached this level, we need such information from you.

199
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.360
If you refuse, Three-Body will shut you out permanently.

200
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.440
Name: Wang Miao.

201
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.110
Education: Doctorate.

202
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.400
Occupation: Chief Engineer of the National Nanomaterial Center.

203
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.780
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

204
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.290
You're qualified for continuing in Three-Body.

205
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.440
May I ask you a question?

206
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.031
Sorry, sir.

207
00:17:55.031 --> 00:17:58.590
As a system administrator, I'm unauthorized to answer any questions.

208
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.000
There will be a meet-up for the players soon.

209
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.030
You're welcome to attend if you're gonna continue playing.

210
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.310
We'll send you the information by email once your identity checks out.

211
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.490
Please check your mailbox.

212
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.510
Are you saying either you go to the meet-up or you're out?

213
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.240
I suppose.

214
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.750
- Have you received the email?
- Not yet.

215
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.350
They'll verify my profile before sending it.

216
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.000
But this new trial in the game has given me another idea.

217
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.240
What is it?

218
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.440
The Three-Body Problem is about physics,

219
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.380
but maybe it can be solved by calculation.

220
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.270
So math?

221
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.100
Yes.

222
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.110
A mathematical model.

223
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.510
We're gonna need a complex one.

224
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.830
Someone thought so, too, but beat you to it by a few months.

225
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.550
You know who it was?

226
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:00.160
Who?

227
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.480
(Shen Yufei)

228
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.330
Shen Yufei.

229
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:12.820
Guess she's been working on a solution to the Three-Body Problem in the game.

230
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.060
To think that she let you in, half-knowing.

231
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.960
Listen, she's hired over 100 experts, including her husband, Wei Cheng,

232
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.900
(Wei Cheng)
to calculate day and night.

233
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.720
I didn't know what they were working on,

234
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.930
but given what you said, it must be the Three-Body Problem.

235
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:34.400
Shen Yufei is more than she shows.

236
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.840
A scientist trying to solve the Three-Body Problem doesn't prove anything.

237
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.020
I know that.

238
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.590
Considering what you two are doing,

239
00:19:53.590 --> 00:20:01.680
I mean, are you gonna be a mathematician next?

240
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.400
Let me ask you something.

241
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.740
Are you and your wife close?

242
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.590
What... what I'm saying is if you and your wife...

243
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.400
if you two, you know...

244
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.510
I mean, if your wife got drunk and she was under the couch,

245
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:26.310
there you were... uh... She didn't throw up, though.

246
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.510
She knocked the cushion to the floor.

247
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.310
At this point, well, normally, she wasn't like that.

248
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.780
- So, what would you... 
 -  My wife never drinks.

249
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.440
Sure.

250
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.430
I know she, uh, she doesn't drink.

251
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.170
Normally, she doesn't.

252
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.470
It's me.

253
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.640
Send me the clips if they're done.

254
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.550
I'll edit them.

255
00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.620
OK. Gotta go. Bye.

256
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.680
I turned off your monitor.

257
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.030
You freaked me out!

258
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.680
A few days ago, a lab in Y City, Country M

259
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.620
suffered a blast in an accident.

260
00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:02.110
Four scientists, including a Nobel laureate, were killed.

261
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.310
I know.

262
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.380
I read the news.

263
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.270
Yes.

264
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.730
That's what the news said.

265
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.590
But it's not true?

266
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:20.880
The four scientists were there for their monthly bridge day.

267
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.000
They didn't do any experiments, so the explosion was only a cover.

268
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.680
Someone is behind all that

269
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.240
to bury the truth and run the made-up story.

270
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.820
But that's not your job to find out.

271
00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.370
Someone else will.

272
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.000
The hidden truths must be uncovered.

273
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.100
What should we do now?

274
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.960
Shen Yufei and I don't always see eye to eye,

275
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.500
but we're forced to take the same path.

276
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.790
Is there really a so-called "farmer"?

277
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:26.750
Are you aware of the Hadza, a primitive tribe in the wilderness of Africa?

278
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:33.760
They're still a hunter-gatherer society living in the caves

279
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.720
and treating the sick with ground herbs.

280
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.250
(The Last Hunter-gatherer Tribe in Africa)
And then you show up with antibiotics

281
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.510
to cure them.

282
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:51.590
You give them seeds so that they'll have food to eat.

283
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:55.920
You teach them calendar and architecture

284
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.440
to build houses outside the caves.

285
00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.070
Because of you, they have a lamp.

286
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.550
Now, in their eyes, you're their Lord.

287
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.270
Let me get this straight.

288
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.480
So we're living in a world where there are more advanced technologies

289
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.160
than we know.

290
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.400
You want people to resist technological development

291
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.590
because however it develops, it's nowhere near Lord's level.

292
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.920
Is that so?

293
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.270
And it does more harm than good.

294
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.820
That's true.

295
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.030
It's polluting everything.

296
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:39.640
Water, light, air, wildlife habitat, and our habitat.

297
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.880
Come to think of it, in a way, technology is advancing

298
00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.000
at the cost of our lives.

299
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.550
Wind and solar power generation have been well-developed,

300
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:55.440
but why are they yet to be widely used for residential power?

301
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.880
Because in that case,

302
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.680
the group that originally controls the resources will lose

303
00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.250
some of their interests forever.

304
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:14.110
I can be their Lord, but what's my goal?

305
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.960
Who are you? A martyr?

306
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.500
Or a clown?

307
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.550
How did you get in?

308
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.680
Wasn't the door closed?

309
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.830
Terminate your calculation.

310
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.750
Not now.

311
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.350
I've just found my way.

312
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.510
There are many more steps to take.

313
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.000
I said stop it. It's meaningless.

314
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I don't care. This is my passion.

315
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.510
Wait outside for Shen Yufei.

316
00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.270
Your toy gun looks so real.

317
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.180
Stop it. It's boring.

318
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200
No, it's not saved!

319
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200
It's gone!

320
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.510
I said stop it right now.

321
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.130
So, uh, it's not a toy, is it?

322
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.750
It's... it's the real deal.

323
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.270
You know what? You're right.

324
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:36.090
My... my calculation is meaningless.

325
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.160
Are you gonna kill him in my face?

326
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.270
Although we do things differently, you should know I'll shoot if I have to.

327
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.270
Call the cops.

328
00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.640
Call the cops.

329
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.470
Call the cops.

330
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.640
Cops?

331
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.410
Even God can't save you.

332
00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:00.570
Commander was blind to allow devils like you to join the organization.

333
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.920
Can you tell which side Commander is on?

334
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.260
Wei Cheng, go back to your room.

335
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.680
OK.

336
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.980
But... but this is... this is my room.

337
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.860
I... I'm going upstairs.

338
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.970
Meaningless.

339
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.850
Wei Cheng was lost for a long time until recently, he made a breakthrough

340
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.000
and found a way.

341
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.350
I wasn't sure if it was right, but your reaction told me it is.

342
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.590
And so what?

343
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:59.400
Maybe it'll take decades from there or to no avail.

344
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.920
You're keeping Lord from coming.

345
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.790
I'm saving it.

346
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.180
Does Lord need your redemption?

347
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.500
Do the shooter and the farmer need consolation from two-dimensional creatures or turkeys?

348
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.790
You aren't Lord.

349
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.590
You can't speak for it.

350
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:23.510
Shen Yufei, were you able to hear Lord's voice?

351
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:34.810
We know Lord is there and it's been guiding us.

352
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.330
But what have you done?

353
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:47.200
You've been separating Lord from us so that it only communicates with you,

354
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.880
and then you tell us what to do in Lord's name.

355
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.310
Don't I have the right to question if your rendering is faithful?

356
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.920
Wei Cheng has only taken one small step.

357
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.960
No one knows if that's right, including you,

358
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:08.480
but I know, because Lord has told me so.

359
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.790
Lord knows everything.

360
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.260
Lord shouldn't be your leverage.

361
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.150
Does Lord care?

362
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.350
The new receiving system is ready to be deployed.

363
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.350
Reception of all bands in the direction of Centaurus will be expanded to the maximum range.

364
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.550
I'll see to it.

365
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:53.950
Also, I've mulled over what Pan Han said. He asked me...

366
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.750
Were you able to hear Lord's voice?

367
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.250
He said, "hear Lord's voice".

368
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.720
Don't worry.

369
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.300
I'll take care of the new system.

370
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.440
We have seven, maybe eight cases.

371
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.790
It's getting out of control.

372
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.240
The North American Sector has had four terrorist attacks.

373
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.920
It seems as though the enemy is escalating.

374
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.750
We just got one case in our sector so far,

375
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.000
but it causes bad influence of public opinion.

376
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.880
General Chang, how about Beijing Sector?

377
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.720
Relatively stable as of now.

378
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.830
No similar cases have happened.

379
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.350
Can we confirm that the attacks are related to our investigation?

380
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.310
Yes.

381
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.270
We managed to capture a few suspects.

382
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.910
What I find odd though is that most of them are known environmentalists and pacifists,

383
00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.270
but somehow, they're turning into violent terrorists,

384
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:36.480
using the same slogan.

385
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.030
"Lord will come to punish vice."

386
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.070
That "Lord" again.

387
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.440
What kind of lord?

388
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.960
Landlord?

389
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.480
"Punish vice."

390
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.640
Whose vice?

391
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.270
Turkeys'?

392
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.960
But what about those rioters?

393
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.960
Aren't they also turkeys?

394
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:59.960
Even if Lord will come, those mobs are using it to mess around.

395
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.030
Although such attacks aren't found in our sector,

396
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.520
we have to stay on guard.

397
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.400
Against what?

398
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.160
I don't even know what this "Lord" is.

399
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.880
Chang, you said those mobs

400
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.720
used to be pacifists and renowned scholars, right?

401
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.930
Do they have anything to do with the Frontiers of Science?

402
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:29.110
It seems to me that they're acting as HR screening out candidates.

403
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:34.310
Is there an even bigger organization backing them?

404
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.860
Wang Miao has passed their screening, hasn't he?

405
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:43.300
It's better that he receives their email ASAP.

406
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.640
Thank you for coming.

407
00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.740
That's all for today.

408
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.630
When was the last time you came here?

409
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.930
Did you send Wei Cheng away so that he can continue his calculation?

410
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.880
You've been escalating things in North America and Europe.

411
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.110
Those are terrorist attacks.

412
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.630
I'm practicing Lord's will.

413
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.360
"Lord will come to punish vice."

414
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:36.920
Once the Three-Body Problem is solved, we'll all be saved.

415
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.000
You naive Redemptionists!

416
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.440
You reject the redemptive power for your goal of destruction, don't you?

417
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.550
Look around. They deserve it.

418
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:52.060
"Human society can no longer rely on its own power to solve its problems."

419
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.370
That's what Commander said.

420
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.280
"Human society can no longer rely on its own power

421
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.970
to restrain its madness.

422
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.550
Therefore, we ask Lord to come to this world,

423
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:10.960
and with its power, forcefully watch over us and transform us

424
00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.820
"so as to create a brand-new, perfect human civilization."

425
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:22.490
That's Commander's original words and our plan, too.

426
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.590
You remember every word of it.

427
00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.280
Having Lord come here is our plan, no?

428
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.960
What the Redemptionists like you are doing?

429
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.260
You really believe your so-called redemption

430
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.000
can solve Lord's problems?

431
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.920
And what you people have done?

432
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.960
You intercepted Lord's messages, distorted Lord's will,

433
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.440
brainwashed and threatened members of our organization nonstop.

434
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.960
I know you, the Adventists, have your own secret agenda, don't you?

435
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.480
That is to destroy all humans.

436
00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.690
The human race is an evil species.

437
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.590
Human civilization has committed unforgivable crimes against the Earth

438
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.220
and must be punished.

439
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.580
The ultimate goal of the Adventists

440
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:17.940
is to ask Lord to carry out this divine punishment: the destruction of all humankind.

441
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.800
That's already an open secret.

442
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.960
With the humans gone, the world will be changed.

443
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.000
That's why we're the Adventists instead of the Terminators.

444
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.070
You misrepresented Lord's will.

445
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.480
You used to be one of us,

446
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.330
but somehow, you were converted to a Redemptionist,

447
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.050
which is slightly better than those cockamamie Survivors.

448
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:54.030
Both you and I know we won't be able to see Lord coming.

449
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.030
The world is beyond redemption,

450
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:02.070
but you're afraid of change
as you see it equals destruction.

451
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:06.600
Only those who rise above death understand the coming of Lord.

452
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.360
You know what Lord's will is?

453
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.230
I'll be able to hear its voice.

454
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.510
Halt Wei Cheng's computation.

455
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.970
End your so-called redemption.

456
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.550
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

457
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:37.280
Clearly, humans can't rely on their own power

458
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.370
to restrain their madness.

459
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:48.280
But I'll keep hope alive and continue saving this broken world.

460
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.320
Wei Cheng is still working on his calculation.

461
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.760
You think he'll make it?

462
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.300
Shen Yufei said she'd be able to hear the voice from the Lord.

463
00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.380
Do you think so?

464
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.800
I want her to stop, completely.

465
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.300
You said it's only human beings who're violated, while the world's changed.

466
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.190
I have a question.

467
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.920
A question?

468
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.070
That is quite unusual of you.

469
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.280
Commander, which side is she on?

470
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.880
The Adventists?

471
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.110
The Redemptionists?

472
00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.220
Or the Survivors?

473
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.330
She... is the Commander.

474
00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:35.220
So why would she choose a side?

475
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.550
Why haven't they sent the email?

476
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.440
Have they forgotten?

477
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.630
It's only been one day.

478
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.480
Be patient.

479
00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.880
(Ye Wenjie)

480
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.400
What's wrong?

481
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.170
Are you surprised?

482
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.670
What is this?

483
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.030
You tell me.

484
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.740
Think about it.

485
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:23.590
Who was it that told you about the Frontiers of Science?

486
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.320
You.

487
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.450
I mean, who first introduced you to the Frontiers of Science?

488
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.320
Shen Yufei.

489
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:38.450
Who made you see the universe flicker?

490
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.400
Shen Yufei.

491
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.930
Who talked you into playing Three-Body?

492
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:45.761
Shen Yufei.

493
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:48.030
You have a one-track mind, don't you?

494
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.900
Think it over.

495
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.920
Without Ye Wenjie, would you see the flicker?

496
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.900
Without Ye Wenjie, would you understand the flying stars?

497
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.900
Without such knowledge, would you get the hang of the game?

498
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.260
I don't want to be suspicious, but she made me.

499
00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.980
She's everywhere in my leads!

500
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.300
Shen Yufei booked a train ticket to Hai City.

501
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.230
K1303, departs at 22:13.

502
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.920
- She's boarded the train...
- Wait. Hold on... Hai City?

503
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.960
Hai City... Shen Yufei.

504
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.400
Hai City.

505
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:27.880
Shen Yufei's foreign-funded company owns a red ginseng factory in Qijiatun.

506
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.920
Qijiatun neighbors Hai City.

507
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.760
It takes only 30 minutes from Hai City to Qijiatun.

508
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.880
(Ye Wenjie)
Does red ginseng need nanotech?

509
00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.510
A few days ago, an old friend from the base brought a gift for me.

510
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.630
Here you are.

511
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.800
(Red Ginseng)
This is the red ginseng you gave me.

512
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.070
Thank you.

513
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.440
She's on a business trip.

514
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.220
They're apples and oranges. So Far-fetched!

515
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.630
Nanotech and ginseng?

516
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.360
No.

517
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.320
What do you mean?

518
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.100
They're unrelated?

519
00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.530
Why didn't you tell me that Ye Wenjie gave you red ginseng?

520
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.100
I didn't know Shen Yufei's company also owns such a factory.

521
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.900
Here it is.

522
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.230
(Address: No. 39, Qijiatun)

523
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.360
No. 39, Qijiatun.

524
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.420
May I use your computer?

525
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.970
Call Ye Wenjie.

526
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:37.761
Now?

527
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.180
Yeah. Do it!

528
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.960
(Xinlai Red Ginseng for Better Health)

529
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.010
This ginseng factory has hardly sold any products. 
 (Processed Ginseng Products)

530
00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.360
They must still be in R&amp;D.

531
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.670
(Please try again later.)

532
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.550
She didn't pick up.

533
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.740
It's 10 PM. Perhaps she's asleep.

534
00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.510
So Ye Wenjie's friend

535
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.400
happened to buy red ginseng from Shen Yufei's factory

536
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.360
that was hardly sold and gave it to her,

537
00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.180
then she regifted it to you. What are the odds?

538
00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:13.550
The ginseng can be kept for six years and it was produced two years ago.

539
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.490
What does that tell us?

540
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:18.260
Shen Yufei and Ye Wenjie go way back!

541

OK.

544
00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:31.660
Found it.

545
00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.520
Ye Wenjie also bought a ticket to Hai City.
