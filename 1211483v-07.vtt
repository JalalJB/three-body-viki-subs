<i>Professor Wang, have you seen through my tricks?</i>

3
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.500
I think it's a device.

<i>Oh? Tell me more.</i>

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.730
You can set up a screen with a width of over 300,000 km

beyond the observation range of all observatories

8
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.170
and project on the screen the universe flicker you wanted to display.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.940
Then I can see it.

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.980
Interesting.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.970
Similarly,

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.560
by setting up a screen with a size of less than 2 mm very close to my pupils,

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.110
you can also project the countdown in front of my eyes.

14
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.260
Don't you think this is all pseudoscience heresy?

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.100
Everything beyond scientific cognition is called pseudoscience heresy at the beginning, right?

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.800
<i>It's like if I went to a primitive tribe right now, where there aren't even electric lights,</i>

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.350
and played an open-air movie for the tribesmen,

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.430
they'll all be as shocked as I was when they see the movie.

19
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.090
Are you saying you're part of a primitive tribe right now?

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.810
You've done so many things just to make me think I am a turkey.

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.390
Fine.

22
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.420
As a turkey scientist, I really want to know which farm I belong to and who the farmer is.

23
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.600
Can I get the answer if I join the Frontiers of Science?

24
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.210

Wang Miao restarted his nanomaterial project.

31
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.080
You failed.

32

Either way, his project hasn't stopped.

It's not your call to decide whether I've failed or not.

We all started from there, didn't we?

38

You are always willing to do such insignificant things.

39
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.910
What I do is more significant than what you do.

It's a little toy made by one of my students.

Currently, it isn't mature enough.

If the battery is big, it'll take up more space.

If it's small, it can't drive a powerful motor.

58

Shen Yufei.

Yes.

62
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.430
Other temples need pilgrims to offer money to stay afloat.

63
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.190
So they want more tourists.

64
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.600
Our temple doesn't.

65
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.550
There aren't many people. It's peaceful.

66
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.720
Most of our visitors are engaged in academic research.

67
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.430
Sometimes when they have problems they can't solve, they'll come here and stay for a couple of days.

68
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.240
The rent here is very high.

69
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.170
It's enough to support us.

70

I've come up with a monk name already, Daydream.

It's not like a sweet dream.

It's a nightmare.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.450
I know.

96
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.600
What do you know?

97
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.920
When your research comes to a dead end, you'll find that

98
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.160
all your research was nothing but a daydream.

99
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.440
I'll leave you alone to talk.

100
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:52.380
Many scientists will look for other means of gratification when they reach an unbreakable bottleneck in their research.

101
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:58.530
They like to come here and ponder the problems they can't solve.

Professor Munphy's last stop was here.

103
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.480
So Professor Munphy's suicide had something to do with you all.

104
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.320
If you committed suicide after you had seen the universe flicker, does it have anything to do with me?

105
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.000
I only told you the truth.

106

I've already decided to join the Frontiers of Science.

107
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.550
So you can tell me now, what the farmer is?

108
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.170
What will happen at the end of the countdown?

109
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.260
Professor Wang, you seem to have gotten used to the countdown in front of your eyes.

Yes.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.540
I was a little anxious and panicked before.

113

But now I'm even looking forward to knowing what will happen at the end of the countdown.

A turkey can be curious too.

What you see is a miracle.

116
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.110
But not everyone can accept the truth behind the miracle.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.220
Are you suggesting that the press is only needed when

163
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.340
environmental problems begin to affect human survival?

164
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.260
I'm in a hurry, Miss Mu.

165
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.170
Let's talk next time.

166
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.120
Mr. Pan, sorry to bother you.

167
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.780
But if I didn't find the information and return it to you, they would have been lost.

168
00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.440
Can I borrow it?

169
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.600
I'll return it to you after I read it.

170
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.580
Give me your number.

171
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.110
Thanks.

172
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.120
Thanks.

173
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.510
- Don't lose it. 
 - Don't worry.

174
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.570
Mu Xing has been attending several academic forums lately and contacted quite a few scientists.

175
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.350
Today she went to a new media forum.

176
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.000
She left during the event and talked with a man called Pan Han for a while.

177
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.530
The man is a biologist engaged in environmental protection.

178
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.960
Environmental protection?

179
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.000
What did they talk about?

180
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.220
<i>Nothing much.</i>

181
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.390
<i>Also Pan Han seemed unwilling to talk to her.</i>

182
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.870
Keep an eye on her.

183
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.400
Alright.

184

<i>[ Three-Body ]</i>

185
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.450
Three-Body?

186
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.460
What's this?

187
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.390
It seems to be a game.

188
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.550
Game?

189
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.490
Log in. Play it.

190
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.360
I can't.

191
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.650
Why can't you play it?

192
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.830
The game requires a V-suit.

193
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.630
V-suit?

194
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.300
What's that?

195
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.440
Old Chang, we need you to pay for the expense of the game suit.

196
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.750
You know what, that suit is amazing.

197
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.580
When you log into the game, you can go up to the sky.

198
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:22.610
Take you for example. If you stamp your foot in the game, you'll leap into the sky like fireworks.

199
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.960
Like Superman.

200
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.130
Have you played it?

201
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.430
I heard it from others.

202
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.730
From who?

203
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.740
People from the Frontiers of Science.

204
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.800
They play the game?

205
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.850
Yeah.

206
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.600
So I need it for work.

207
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.760
Hurry, pay for it. It's just a little expensive.

208
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.810
You should report the expense to Finance.

209
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.770
If I could make them understand, would I need to come find you?

210
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.150
By the way, I heard from the European Combat Zone this morning,

211
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:51.160
in Northern Europe, another scientist committed suicide.

212
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.550
So, it's urgent.

213
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.750
Don't worry, Old Chang.

214
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.910
With this, I'll definitely pass the game.

215
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.600
Do you think it's as easy as playing Snake?

216
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.450
You and Wang Miao must try your best.

<i>[ Chang Weisi ]</i>

218
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.430
My gloves are a little tight.

219
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.440
So are mine.

220
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.420
Is this how you wear it?

221
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.030
Okay.

222
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:36.680
You said Shen Yufei told you the website of the game and the shop that sold the V-suits.

223
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.630
These things are really expensive too.

224
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.060
Do you think she's a saleswoman?

225
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.900
The development costs of games played with V-suits is beyond your imagination.

226
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.560
Can I wear this?

227
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.100
The countdown timer.

228
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.310
Is it electrified?

229
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.750
Take it off. Don't wear it.

230
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.800
I can't. We agreed to live and die together.

231
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.840
Okay, that's it. Ready.

232
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.720
Okay.

233
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.920
Be careful when you log in.

234
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.220
Don't worry.

235
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.980
After having been a cop for so many years, I've caught 29 bad guys with my bare hands,

236
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.980
knocked down 17 guys and shot 16 with my gun.

237
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.340
Enough, enough.

238
00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.740
Don't beat people randomly when you get in the game.

239
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.910
How could I?

240
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.580
I even don't know what it's like in there.

241

Maybe we're all turkeys and we can only peck at each other.

King Wen doesn't belong to the Warring States Period, right?

He's survived until now.

King Zhou of Shang is alive, too.

Of course.

This is sandglass.

Every eight hours, all the sand flows to the bottom.

267

Flip it three times and you can measure a day.

268

But I often forget to flip it, and I need Follower here to remind me.

Hey.

270
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.950
You seem to be on a very long journey.

271
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.800
Is it necessary to carry such a bulky clock?

272
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.890
Or what?

273
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.670
How else would we measure time?

274
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.480
You can carry a portable sundial.

275
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.180
Or you can just look at the sun and know the approximate time.

<i>How can the sun tell us the time?</i>

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.960
<i>We're in the midst of a Chaotic Era.</i>

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.190
Chaotic Era?

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.300
<i>It's so cold! I'm almost frozen.</i>

281

<i>Hurry, let's go. It'll be colder if we stop.</i>

282
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.970
When the sun comes out, it'll be warmer.

283
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.400
<i>Are you pretending to be some kind of oracle?</i>

<i>Even King Wen cannot predict the future.</i>

285
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.850
Do you need an oracle to predict that?

286
00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:11.530
Everyone can see that the sun will rise in about another hour or two.

287
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.580
This is a Chaotic Era!

288
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.190
What is a Chaotic Era?

289
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.240
Other than Stable Eras, all other times are Chaotic Eras.

290
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.260
Is the Chaotic Era known to all?

291
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.860
Look at the sun.

292
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.600
So it's dusk instead of dawn?

293
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.400
It is dawn.

294
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.300
But the sun doesn't always rise at dawn.

295
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.500
That's what a Chaotic Era is like.

296
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.000
It looks like the sun won't rise for a long time.

297
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.500
What makes you think that?

298
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.200
There's no way to be certain.

299
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.400
Ji Chang, may I have some dried fish?

300
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.200
No.

301
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.000
I barely have enough for myself.

302
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.600
We must guarantee that I make it to Zhaoge, not you.

303
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.200
Look over there!

304
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.600
The sun is rising over there.

305
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.400
But the direction is different from last time.

306
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.500
Are we going the wrong way?

307
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.200
I told you it's a Chaotic Era.

308
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.300
Finally, it's getting warmer.

309
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.200
But why is the sun bluish in color?

310
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.200
Why did it set so soon?

311
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.200
These branches.

312
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.900
We can use some as firewood.

313
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.200
Hurry, hurry up.

314
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.200
You know what? I hate lighting a fire the most.

315
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.900
Guys, do you know a man called Wang Miao?

316
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.100
Wang Miao?

317
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.400
I don't know him.

318
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.800
Why don't you join us?

319
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.600
Aren't you cold? Warm yourself by the fire.

320
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600
It really is cold.

321
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.600
If we... burn some of the dehydrated bodies, we'll get an even warmer fire going.

322
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.000
Nonsense! Only the tyrant King Zhou would do that!

323
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.300
The dehydrated bodies are scattered about everywhere.

324
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.700
They've been torn, and won't be revivable even if they're rehydrated.

325
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:55.100
If your theory really works, we can even eat some, let alone burn a few of them.

326
00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.300
How can a few lives compare to the importance of your theory?

327
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.200
No way.

328
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.000
No way!

329
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.400
We're scholars!

330
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.600
It's finally burnt out.

331
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.300
Let's continue our journey.

332
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.100
Who do you follow?

333
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.000
Follow?

334
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.600
Let me put it this way.

335
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.600
What do you research?

336
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.000
Are you a newcomer?

337
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Yeah, I'm a rookie.

338
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.800
We follow King Zhou and we're going to Zhaoge.

339
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.200
Do you want to join us?

340
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
Be an accessory to a tyrant?

341
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Forget it. Zhaoge is too far.

342
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.200
I still have to find my friend.

343
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.000
Where is Miao?

344
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.280
No, no.

345
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.900
We'll have enough today.

346
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.500
We've flipped the sandglass six times already.

347
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.900
It's been two days.

348
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.200
In these two days, the sun never rose once,

349
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.500
not even a hint of dawn over the horizon.

350
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.200
It seems that the sun will never rise again.

351
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.600
I told you not to pretend to be an oracle.

352
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.400
This is a Chaotic Era!

353
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.700
The sun is rising over there!

354
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.000
Look!

355
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
It looks like a normal sun!

356
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.400
I'm warning you! Don't pretend to be an oracle!

357
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.600
It's finally getting warm.

358
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.500
Oh, no!

359
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.000
What should we do?

360
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.500
Find shade quickly!

361
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500
What's wrong?

362
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.700
Hurry. Hurry.

363
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.300
What's wrong?

364
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.200
Traveling during a Chaotic Era is like walking through hell.

365
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.400
I can't stand it anymore.

366
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.400
I can't.

367
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.800
Then you should be dehydrated.

368
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800
Okay.

369
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800
Wait.

370
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.400
You won't abandon me, will you?

371
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400
Don't worry.

372
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.200
I promise to bring you to Zhaoge.

373
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.700
Okay.

374
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.000
Dehydrate me.

375
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.900
What's happening to him?

376
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.400
Is he dead?

377
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.300
No.

378
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.400
After dehydrating, he only needs to be soaked in water to recover.

379
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.800
It's just like soaking dried mushrooms.

380
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.600
Even his bones have turned soft?

381
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.000
Yes.

382
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.600
They've turned into dried fibers.

383
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.700
This makes him easy to carry.

384
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.100
In this world, can everyone be dehydrated?

385
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.400
Of course. You can, too.

386
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.000
Otherwise we couldn't survive the Chaotic Eras.

387
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.600
You carry him.

388
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.700
Oh, no!

389
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.300
My friend.

390
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.200
No, wait.

391
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.000
I have to go find him.

392
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.200
If a turkey doesn't drink water, will it die of thirst?

393
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.300
If you can't stand it, you can choose to be dehydrated.

394
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.500
Dehydrated?

395
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.400
How does one dehydrate?

396
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.500
You only have to say

397
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.600
these two words.
<i>[Dehydrate me]</i>

398
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.200
This is the password.

399
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.600
Is this some kind of trap?

400
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.400
What do you get if I say dehydrate me?

401
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.000
I, I...

402
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.400
What are you doing?

403
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.000
Who are you?

404
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.100
Give him back to me.

405
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.800
He's my friend!

406
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.900
Give him back to me!

407
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.500
Don't you know he's already dehydrated?

408
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.200
The only way he contributes to this civilization is to be our food or firewood.

409
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.000
You're being completely unreasonable!

410
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.200
Give him back to me!

411
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.600
- Give him back!
- Wang Miao. Wang Miao!

412
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.200
Give him back to me!

413
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.800
You don't understand the truth of this world.

414
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.400
Wang Miao, hang in there.

415
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.000
I'll log in right now. Hang in there.

416
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.900
Wait a minute.

417
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.700
In order to achieve our goals,

418
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.000
<i>[Game Over]</i>

419
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.700
this is nothing.

420
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.800
How is your friend?

421
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.600
He was dehydrated and taken by some guys.

422
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.100
What will happen to him?

423
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.700
It's normal.

424
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.800
He can't adapt to this world.

425
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.100
Let's head off.

426
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.300
I can finally have water.

427
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.600
How long has it been?

428
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.200
About a month.

429
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.100
It's either extremely hot or extremely cold.

430
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.000
The Chaotic Era is killing me.

431
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.400
Flying stars.

432
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.200
Two flying stars!

433
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.600
We saw them yesterday too.

434
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.300
They look bigger than ordinary stars.

435
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.200
Yes.

436
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.300
They show up as disks.

437
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.900
They move through the sky quickly enough for the naked eye to detect the motion.

438
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.400
But it's different this time!

439
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.600
How come?

440
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.900
This time there are two of them.

441
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.300
Two flying stars!

442
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.000
A Stable Era is about to begin!

443
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.800
Is two the most we'll see at once?

444
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.900
No. Sometimes three will appear, but no more than that.

445
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.000
If three flying stars appear, does that herald an even better era?

446
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.200
What are you talking about?

447
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.000
Three flying stars?

448
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.400
Pray that such a thing never happens.

449
00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.200
It hasn't been this pleasant in a long time.

450
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.000
How long does this Stable Era last?

451
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.600
A day or a century.

452
00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.200
No one can predict it.

453
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.700
According to historical records, the Western Zhou Dynasty experienced a Stable Era lasting two centuries.

454
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.800
How lucky to be born during such a time!

455
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800
What about a Chaotic Era?

456
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.600
How long does that last?

457
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.800
I already told you.

458
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800
Other than Stable Eras, all other times belong to Chaotic Eras.

459
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.200
Each of them takes up the time not occupied by the other.

460
00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.800
This is a world in which there are no patterns.

461
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.200
That's right.

462
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.500
Civilization here can only develop in the mild climate of Stable Eras.

463
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.900
Most of the time, humankind must collectively dehydrate and be stored.

464
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.300
When a long Stable Era arrives, they collectively revive through rehydration.

465
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.000
Then they proceed to build and produce.

466
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.700
How can we predict the arrival and duration of each Stable Era?

467
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.800
You can't.

468
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.100
Nobody can do it.

469
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.500
Whenever a Stable Era arrives,

470
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.700
the King makes a decision based on intuition as to whether to engage in mass rehydration.

471
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.500
Often, the people are revived,

472
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.000
crops are planted, cities begin construction, life has just started,

473
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
and then the Stable Era ends.

474
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.900
Extreme cold and heat then destroy everything.

475
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.000
Congratulations.

476
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.800
Now you know the goal of this game.

477
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.600
It's to use our intellect and understanding

478
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.500
to analyze all phenomena until we can understand the pattern of the sun's movement.

479
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.800
The survival of civilization depends on it.

480
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.200
Based on my observations, there is no pattern to the sun's movement at all.

481
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.000
That's because you don't understand the fundamental nature of the world yet.

482
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.400
And you do?

483
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.800
Yes!

484
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:43.400
I'm headed to Zhaoge to present King Zhou with an accurate calendar.

485
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.200
How long before we get to Zhaoge?

486
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.400
Soon. We'll be there soon.

487
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.600
Do you hear something?

488
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.400
That's the sound of the pendulums.

489
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.800
We've arrived in Zhaoge.

490
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.400
Those are the pendulums.

491
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.000
The sight of them suggests the end of our journey.

492
00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.000
<i>Help!</i>

493
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.600
<i>Hurry up!</i>

494
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.000
There's a pyramid in Zhaoge?

495
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.200
Yes.

496
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.600
In order to survive during a Chaotic Era,

497
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.600
one must live in thick-walled buildings like this one,

498
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.800
as though one were living underground.

499
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.400
It's the only way to avoid the extreme heat and cold.

500
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.900
My king.

501
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.100
My beloved deputy, as you were.

502
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.100
This is Fu Xi.

503
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.600
Apparently he has his own theory.

504
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.200
Yes. He thinks that the sun is a temperamental god.

505
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.400
When the god is awake, his moods are unpredictable, and thus we have a Chaotic Era.

506
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.200
But when he's asleep, his breathing evens out, and thus we have a Stable Era.

507
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:31.100
Fu Xi suggested that I build those pendulums out there and keep them in constant motion.

508
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:35.700
He claims that the pendulums can have a hypnotic effect on the sun god

509
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:39.300
and cause him to sink into a long slumber.

510
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.900
I've never heard of anyone who could hypnotize the sun before.

511
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.700
It doesn't seem useful though.

512
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.800
That's right.

513
00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.400
So far, the sun god remains awake,

514
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.200
though from time to time he naps briefly.

515
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
What is he going to do?

516
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.000
Go to hell!

517
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.600
Foolish witchcraft.

518
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.200
What have you learned about the sun?

519
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.400
My king, the sun is not a god.

520
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.600
The sun is yang, and the night is yin.

521
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.000
The world proceeds on the balance between yin and yang.

522
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.700
Though we can't control it, we can predict it.

523
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.800
If you can predict it, you'll be the hero of the world.

524
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.800
But many people who have claimed to be able to predict it ended up in the bronze cauldron.

525
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.800
My king,

526
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.100
this is the code of the universe.

527
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.000
With it, I can present your dynasty

528
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
with an accurate calendar!

529
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.200
Ji Chang,

530
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.900
I'm eager to know when the next long Stable Era will come.

531
00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.000
I will forecast it for you right now.

532
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.700
Next will be a Chaotic Era lasting 41 days.

533
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.400
Then comes a five-day Stable Era.

534
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.100
Thereafter, there will be a 23-day Chaotic Era

535
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.800
followed by an 18-day Stable Era.

536
00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.100
Then we'll have an eight-day Chaotic Era.

537
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.000
But when this Chaotic Era is over,

538
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.500
my king, the long Stable Era you've been waiting for will begin.

539
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.200
That Stable Era will last three years and nine months.

540
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:38.000
The climate will be so mild that it will be a golden age.

541
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.600
King Zhou doesn't seem to be

542
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.500
that excited about the accurate prediction.

543
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.000
We have to verify your predictions first.

544
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.200
Report!

545
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.600
My king, all the initial predictions have been verified.

546
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.600
Ji Chang, I shall erect a monument for you,

547
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.800
one even greater than this palace!

548
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.800
My king, awaken your dynasty and let it prosper!

549
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.600
Rehydrate!

550
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.800
Rehydrate!

551
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.400
Rehydrate!

552
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.600
Rehydrate!

553
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.000
Rehydrate!

554
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.600
Rehydrate!

555
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.800
Rehydrate!

556
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.900
Rehydrate!

557
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:03.000
Rehydrate!

558
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.700
Rehydrate!

559
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.200
My foot!

560
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.400
My finger!

561
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.800
My finger!

562
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.000
How long have we been dehydrated?

563
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.300
If they weren't rehydrated in time,

564
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.200
they would all have been eaten by the Chaotic Era rats.

565
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.600
Enjoy the beautiful Stable Era!

566
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.000
You're the lucky ones!

567
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:19.000
