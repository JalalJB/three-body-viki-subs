â™ªI don't know who I amâ™ª

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.860
â™ªAnd I don't know where I amâ™ª

â™ªWhen I just can't leave my landâ™ª

â™ªOn my wayâ™ª

â™ªTo endless darknessâ™ª

â™ªWaiting for your boatâ™ª

â™ªCan you take me from the old worldâ™ª

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.000
â™ªBut now we cannot stopâ™ª

â™ªAll my life feels me sailingâ™ª

14
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.890
â™ªWe'll stop in timeâ™ª

â™ªThe falling stars are still alive every nightâ™ª

19
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.790
Haven't you been suspicious
of Ye Wenjie all along?

20
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.790
What's so strange about her
having dealings with Shen Yufei?

21
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.150
Declassified file.

22
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.510
The declassified file of Ye Wenjie.

23
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.710
You've been dawdling
for quite some time.

24
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.150
Are you constipated or something?

25
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.680
It's just a declassified file.

26
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.470
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

27
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.000
I need to go to Hai City tomorrow.

28
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.310
Hai City?

29
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.560
Ye Wenjie and Shen Yufei are both going to Hai City tomorrow, which is very abnormal.

30
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.000
Tomorrow I'll have Wang Miao go there
with me to investigate.

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.630
Is Hai City where I get off the bus
if my destination is Qijiatun?

32
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.560
Qijiatun is where we're going.

33
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.150
Do you know what's in Qijiatun?

34
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.560
Shen Yufei has
a red ginseng factory there.

35
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.170
Red Coast Base.

36
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.750
- Where are you going?
- The declassified file.

37
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.290
You just won't think of water
until your house is on fire.

38
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.150
Do we really have to catch the flight early
tomorrow morning to the Northeast

39
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.030
and then catch a train to Hai City?

40
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.310
Yeah. If we fail to catch the same train
as theirs,

41
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.910
they'll get to Qijiatun
way before we do.

42
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.710
Don't worry.

43
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.780
I've contacted
our associate department there.

44
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080
They'll meet us at the airport and then
drive us straight to the train station.

45
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.710
Police escort.

46
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.400
Hop in.

47
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.920
Hello?

48
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.360
A guy wanting to kill you
is outside the door.

49
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.030
Push the flush button after hanging up,
and then do nothing.

50
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.730
After you hear someone knock three times
on the door, open it and leave.

51
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.940
Repeat what I just said.

52
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.310
Hang up.

53
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.270
Flush.

54
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.120
Leave after hearing someone
knock three times.

55
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.030
Go to car No. 1.

56
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.100
(Occupied)

57
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.870
What is wrong with you?

58
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.090
Watch where you're going, okay?

59
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.530
I'm carrying a bowl of instant noodles!
Why did you bump into me?

60
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.590
How unbelievably rash you are!

61
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.690
Commander.

62
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.730
They're making their move.

63
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.210
Just now, were it not for Chen Xueâ€¦

64
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.040
You don't love me anymore?

65
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.360
What will I do?

66
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.150
It's okay now.

67
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.600
Let Chen Xue get you back home.

68
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.500
Some professionals will handle the equipment, and I'll keep watch on it personally.

69
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.790
A few days ago,
Headhunter Qi's son told me

70
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.750
a foreigner had come to the village
to be a volunteer teacher.

71
00:08:53.750 --> 00:09:01.520
He taught the kids to protect spruce
and skylark, and he loves planting trees.

72
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.350
It's him.

73
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.070
He's been in the village
for several days.

74
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.270
Will he find out about our system?

75
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.930
What does it matter
if he finds out or not?

76
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.410
The next stop is Shanhai Pass.

77
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.440
We'll get off there.

78
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.630
We can't stay on this train anymore.

79
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.600
Their target is me.

80
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.050
The Adventists have all gone crazy.

81
00:09:53.260 --> 00:10:02.430
It's impossible for humans
to repress their madness unaided.

82
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.320
Commander, I have a question.

83
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.090
You want to verify
if I'm in favor of the Redemptionists.

84
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.970
In the beginning, there were no such factions as Adventists, Redemptionists,
or Survivors.

85
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.840
When they made me Commander,

86
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.670
I didn't know
there would be so many disagreements.

87
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:40.200
Why did humans
fail to finish the Tower of Babel?

88
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.400
God saw that humans might be able
to finish the Tower of Babel,

89
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.500
so he gave humans different languages,
rendering them unable to communicate

90
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.200
with or understand each other.

91
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.730
It was Lord
who caused our disagreements.

92
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:10.320
Humans choose the side in line
with their intentions.

93
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.430
Does Lord do the same?

94
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.570
Does Lord want destruction
or redemption?

95
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.870
Let's get off the train
and listen to Lord's voice.

96
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.170
Then we'll know
what we should do next.

97
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.790
It's been two years.

98
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.770
Lord has never given us any messages.

99
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.810
Silence is also a message.

100
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.120
You got back at something after ten,
and you're leaving at five.

101
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.150
How can you go on a business trip
on such short notice?

102
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.520
Shh. Keep your voice down.

103
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.390
You might wake Doudou up.

104
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.570
I don't have a choice. It's work.

105
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.570
Where are you going?

106
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.960
Hai City.

107
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.240
There's a
nanotech red ginseng processing plant.

108
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.030
I'm going there for a field trip.

109
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.630
That's over 30 hours' train ride.

110
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.270
You'll be away
for three or four days, right?

111
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.540
I'll get back as soon as I can.

112
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.100
- Take this. You may eat it during the ride.
- Alright. Shove it in.

113
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.510
Okay. I'll bring you back some goodies.

114
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.300
I've got to go.

115
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.550
What's wrong?

116
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.630
Why do you look a bit down?

117
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.960
Got up too early?

118
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.120
You woke up on the wrong side
of the bed?

119
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.620
Or was it your wife?

120
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.120
Your wife got up too early as well?

121
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.630
You didn't sleep well last night, right?

122
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.390
You look a bit overexcited.

123
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.050
I can get excited whenever I want.

124
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.440
I looked it up yesterday.

125
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.000
There's no plane bound for
the Northeast at this hour.

126
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.220
Which airline did you take?

127
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.870
SA341.

128
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.550
Which airline is SA?

129
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.240
SA341 is a gunship.

130
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.720
- What do you mean by "Huh"?
- It's too short notice.

131
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.670
Chang was supposed
to swing us a J-10 Fighter,

132
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.390
but SA341 is acceptable, I guess.

133
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.290
Anyway, we'll get
to the Northeast in two hours.

134
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.360
There's plenty of time.

135
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.420
We'll even have time for breakfast.

136
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.750
Is it safe?

137
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.480
Don't worry. It won't fall. I got this.

138
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.340
This is the breakfast you talked about?

139
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.790
Just make do with it.

140
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.240
We'll be cooped up on this train
for over 20 hours.

141
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.720
It'll be such a long ride.

142
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.840
Why didn't you buy us
some decent tickets?

143
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.040
Chang can handle military departments, but not the Ministry of Railways.

144
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.490
We've walked from end to end several times,
but there's been no trace of them.

145
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.200
Eat faster.
We'll search again after breakfast.

146
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.330
Grid search.

147
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.590
Your ticket and ID card, please.

148
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.700
How about we get some help
from your associate department?

149
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.550
Comrades,
your tickets and ID cards, please.

150
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.340
They got on board at the last stop.
Is everything okay?

151
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.440
Yeah.

152
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.360
Alright.

153
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.250
What's wrong?

154
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.630
Something happened, right?

155
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.570
Looking for suspects?

156
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.740
The body
was removed a few stops from here.

157
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.790
He'd been dead
for over three hours when found.

158
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.080
(Occupied)
This door was locked all along,

159
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.550
and at that time all the passengers
were asleep.

160
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.910
Nobody noticed.

161
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.390
The next morning,
the door was still locked.

162
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.670
A train conductor knocked for quite
some time but there was no response.

163
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.270
She opened the door with the key
only to find him dead.

164
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.340
Did you just say
his neck was snapped?

165
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.200
Yeah.

166
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.910
The murderer's a good fighter,
and very professional.

167
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.720
All the victim's identifying information
has been disposed of.

168
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:08.660
We searched this train several times but found no trace of Shen Yufei or Ye Wenjie.

169
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.680
- Did anybody get off the train early?
- There's no way to know.

170
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.070
I see. Thank you, bro.
I'll call you if I need your help.

171
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:19.950
- Okay, okay.
- Alright.

172
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.830
Someone died on this train,
and they're not on board.

173
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.070
Something's not right.

174
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.410
What do you mean?

175
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.590
Call her.

176
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:38.920
Call Professor Ye.

177
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.170
She didn't answer your call
yesterday, right? Try again.

178
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.350
Do it.

179
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.160
Go inside first.

180
00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.720
Hello?

181
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.550
Ms. Ye, I'd like to
consult you about something in person.

182
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.060
I'm not in Beijing right now.

183
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.860
Where are you?

184
00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:19.970
I'm on my way back to Qijiatun
to visit some old friends.

185
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.590
Going there by train
takes over 30 hours, right?

186
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.480
That's really tiring.

187
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.010
Yeah.

188
00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:35.830
Originally, I wanted to take the train,
but it'd take 30-odd hours.

189
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:40.210
My friends were afraid I'd be exhausted,
so they arranged a car for me.

190
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.200
- It'll be faster.
- She's not on the train.

191
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.560
And I can get out of the car
for a break whenever I want.

192
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.590
Ms. Ye, the Red Coast Base is
in Qijiatun, right?

193
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.160
I'd like to see it.

194
00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.670
Is that okay?

195
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.000
Alright.

196
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.360
I'll wait for you in Qijiatun.

197
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.610
Okay, Ms. Ye, bye.

198
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.720
You're letting Wang Miao
come to Red Coast?

199
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.360
There are some things
he'll need to know sooner or later.

200
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.750
Right now we can only find out
if they bought tickets or not.

201
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.000
There's no way
to verify any of the subsequent events.

202
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.150
I need to have someone look into it.

203
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:51.510
You think they got something
to do with the murder?

204
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.510
We can't rule out that possibility.

205
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:59.750
Well, the cop says that guy's taller and heavier than me, and he had his neck snapped.

206
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.880
Do you think Professor Ye
can do something like that?

207
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.790
Or do you think Shen Yufei can do it?

208
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:09.310
You have a point, but I still feel
it's a hell of a coincidence.

209
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.930
The problem is we're trapped on a train.

210
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.300
We can't look into anything.

211
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.310
There are over ten hours to go.

212
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.210
Even Professor Ye knows traveling by car
is faster than traveling by train.

213
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:25.970
Can't you just have them fly us to Qijiatun with that SA361 thing?

214
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.600
Everybody says scientists are rational.
Why are you such an exception?

215
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.160
10-odd hours aren't exactly a long time.

216
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.750
We can use the time
to think about problems.

217
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.590
You may think about that nano-Flying-Knife
thing or whatever its name is.

218
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.550
I didn't bring any materials.

219
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.900
Then have some sleep.

220
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.640
There are many couchettes available now.

221
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.100
I don't want to sleep here.

222
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:57.900
Commander.

223
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.060
- Commander.
- Commander. - Commander.

224
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.400
Resume your work.

225
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.960
We've maximized the reception of all frequencies

226
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.100
from the direction of Centauri, but there's still no message whatsoever.

227
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.510
Keep monitoring.

228
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.100
Yes.

229
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.820
Time to go.

230
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.980
We're going back?

231
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:25.450
I mean it's time for the machines and devices to go.

232
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:31.440
Commander, we've only just built this reception system.

233
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.810
Dismantle it.

234
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.370
Are you doing this because you've accepted the fact that the Adventists are in contact with Lord?

235
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:48.300
I admit Lord exists.

236
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.640
If we had received messages from Lord,

237
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:58.790
it would've meant Lord can contact us and is willing to contact us,

238
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.920
and we would be able to change many things.

239
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.270
But now we've received no message whatsoever.

240
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:18.720
If Lord is unwilling to contact us and has chosen the Adventists,

241
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.910
then everything we did was pointless.

242
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.950
If they can't receive any messages from Lord either,

243
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:36.550
then maybe we need to change them.

244
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.160
I get it now.

245
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.400
Don't be dismayed.

246
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.340
This is not a bad thing.

247
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.310
Commander, it's settled.

248
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.550
The reception system will be dismantled with no trace left behind.

249
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.930
You may go back to Beijing without me.

250
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.140
Wang Miao will be here soon.

251
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.240
It's best if he doesn't see us together.

252
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.400
(Incoming call from Shen Yufei)

253
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.480
Hello?

254
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.880
Pan Han, it's me.

255
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.930
Commander?

256
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:10.580
Please tell Evans
it's time for us to meet.

257
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:13.310
I'm in Red Coast.

258
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.440
Yes.

259
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.780
This is the village entrance. Is this where you and Ye Wenjie agreed to meet?

260
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.790
Yeah.

261
00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.570
(Qijiatun)
Professor Ye said a villager would come to pick me up,

262
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.620
that I might wait under the big cypress outside the village.

263
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.680
I think it's that one.

264
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.790
It's almost time.

265
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.270
How about you wait here for her?

266
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.820
I'll pay a visit to the village committee to get some information about Shen Yufei's factory.

267
00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.370
Alright.

268
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.240
When you see Ye Wenjie,

269
00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.540
memorize what she says and tell me when I get back.

270
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.210
I will.

271
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.350
Are you Wang Miao?

272
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.770
You're Wang Miao, right?

273
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.350
I am.

274
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.860
I'm Qi Jianguo. Hop on. Professor Ye sent me here to pick you up.

275
00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.810
Hop on. Hop on.

276
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.110
Alright.

277
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.060
Take it easy. Be careful.

278
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.110
Hold on tight.

279
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.460
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

280
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.350
Does Professor Ye come back often?

281
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.960
No.

282
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.200
But she used to live in our village when she was younger.

283
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.590
She boarded with us. We're very close.

284
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.790
I heard there's a red ginseng factory in your village.

285
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.590
Yes, there is.

286
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.550
The owner's a foreigner.

287
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.480
He rented a large piece of land from us.

288
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.480
He said it'd help us get re-employed.

289
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.070
I think it's a great idea.

290
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.620
Those who don't want to be peasants may work in the factory.

291
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.790
Work? What kind of work?

292
00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.960
Cleaning ginseng, digging ginseng, picking out ginseng,

293
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.160
and watching the factory for them.

294
00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.160
Does Professor Ye have anything to do with the factory?

295
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.620
I don't think so.

296
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.900
That's a foreigner's factory.

297
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.640
What could she have to do with it?

298
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.110
By the way, there's a flashlight in there.

299
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.590
Professor Ye told me to give it to you.

300
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.610
Ms. Ye!

301
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.070
Ms. Ye, this is it?

302
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.380
Yeah.

303
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.440
This is Red Coast.

304
00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:25.790
At that time, I thought I'd never be able to leave this place,

305
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.340
but after getting out, I miss it a lot.

306
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.350
(Beware of Electricity)

307
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.110
Now this base is abandoned.

308
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:38.540
Maybe because demolishing it would be too costly,

309
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:45.200
they only transferred the important scientific research apparatus,

310
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.850
and the overall frame of Red Coast survived.

311
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:20.440
(Those on duty in the Transmission Department, attention, please.)

312
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.110
(The computer magnetic core storage in the Transmission Department)

313
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.750
(displays a failure code.)

314
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:31.930
(Maintenance personnel are to go and fix it immediately.)

315
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.510
(The computer magnetic core storage in the Transmission Department)

316
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.540
(displays a failure code.)

317
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.800
(Maintenance personnel are to go and fix it immediately.)

318
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.100
So this is Red Coast.

319
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.270
On both sides used to be machines and devices.

320
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.200
(At 5:00 PM, there will be a sanitary check)

321
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.270
(on the mainframe cabinet between transmitters and receivers.)

322
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:06.000
(Please prepare ahead of time.)

323
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.610
Here and there used to be occupied by apparatus.

324
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.000
When I first joined Red Coast,

325
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.940
I was responsible for maintaining and repairing those machines.

326
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.090
Here used to be Yang Weining's office.

327
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.440
Lei Zhicheng's was there.

328
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.280
(According to the latest weather forecast,)

329
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.550
(from 8:00 AM today to 8:00 PM tomorrow,)

330
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.780
(there will be heavy snow or even a snowstorm)

331
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.320
(in some areas of the Northeast.)

332
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.920
(The high tomorrow will be 2 degrees Celsius,)

333
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.640
(and the low will be minus 18.)

334
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.530
(Sunny. Level 6 southeast wind.)

335
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.380
This used to be an elevator.

336
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.630
Let's take the stairs.

337
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.380
Okay.

338
00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.190
Be careful.

339
00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.740
Did this used to be the Monitoring Department of Red Coast?

340
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:04.510
Ms. Ye, the other day you said you got transferred out of the Transmission Department.

341
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.020
You were moved here, right?

342
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.880
Yes.

343
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:18.080
At that time, I thought I'd never get a core technical position again.

344
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:26.350
Afterward I discovered that the core of Red Coast was actually here.

345
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:27.960
Core?

346
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.060
That concerned the real purpose of Red Coast.

347
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:42.280
I know even to this day, that part is still classified.

348
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.180
Now that you've already come here, there's actually no harm in telling you.

349
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.070
there's actually no harm in telling you.

350
00:38:53.070 --> 00:39:00.350
It was in this room that I came to find out pthe truth about Red Coast.

351
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.800
But how is she supposed to do her job

352
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.820
if you keep concealing things from her like this?

353
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.410
I see it differently.

354
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.630
I think if you tell her too much,

355
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.640
- it'll definitely createâ€¦
- Report!

356
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:34.590
- Anyway, remember where the limit is.
- I know what to say.

357
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.970
Wenjie, come in.

358
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.150
Wenjie, this is an official decision.

359
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.380
From this day onwards, you'll be working in the Monitoring Department.

360
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.600
Now I'll explain the work of the Monitoring Department to you.

361
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.670
Simply put, the goal is to keep an eye

362
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:11.410
on all enemy activities in space, including intercepting communications

363
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.920
between enemy space vessels and the ground, and between the space vessels themselves,

364
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.230
track the orbits of enemy space vessels,

365
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.230
collaborate with our telemetry and tracking centers,

366
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.550
and provide data for Red Coast's combat systems.

367
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.280
In other words, the eyes of Red Coast are here.

368
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:31.550
Political Commissar Lei, I think you should reconsider

369
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.000
whether it's necessary to tell her this.
