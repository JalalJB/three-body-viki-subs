00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.804
Captain Shi, let's go.

157
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.596
<i>What's wrong with Shi Qiang?</i>

158
00:11:34.596 --> 00:11:36.180
<i>The general specifically requested him.</i>

159
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.130
<i>I guess he must have some special skills.</i>

160
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.310
<i>How can a man like that be part of the Battle Command Center?</i>

161
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.910
<i>[A millennium of blessings]</i>

162
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.740
Battle Command Center?

163
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.650
Please wait here for a moment. Someone will come get you.

164
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.890
Okay, thanks.

165
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.060
<i>Strengthen the monitoring of the six field observatories of Purple Mountain Observatory,</i>

166
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.200
<i>including Delhi Radio Astronomical Observatory of Qinghai Province, </i>

167
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.160
<i>Xuyi Celestial Mechanics Observatory of Jiangsu Province, </i>

168
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.750
<i>Ganyu Solar Observatory of Jiangsu Province, </i>

169
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.950
<i>Honghe Observatory of Heilongjiang Province, </i>

170
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.990
<i>Qingdao Observatory of Shandong Province, </i>

171
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.730
<i>Yao'an Observatory of Yunnan Province.</i>

172
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.910
<i>The meeting will start in ten minutes.</i>

173
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.890
<i>All departments, please get ready.</i>

174
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.640
- Professor Wang. 
 <i>- and attend the meeting on time.</i>

175
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.750
I'm sorry. I was really rude this morning.

176
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:19.280
My leader criticized me and had me come get you in order to apologize to you.

177
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.370
What do you think of the place? Strange, right?

178
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.460
Everyone thinks it's strange when they first come here.

179
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.750
Why is such a secret organization set up in this place?

180
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.130
It was supposed to be an art museum.

181
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.970
But it was requisitioned before it could open.

182
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.940
Come on, let me give you a tour. Come.

183
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.720
I hear that you're researching some kind of new material?

184
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.660
Yes. Nanomaterial.

185
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:46.240
I heard that a strand of that stuff could be used to lift up a truck.

186
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.280
If criminals steal some and make it into a knife, can't they slice a truck in half with one stroke?

187
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.850
First, there's no need to even make it into a knife.

188
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.480
That kind of material can be made into a line as thin as one-hundredth of a hair.

189
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.190
If you string it across a road, a passing car would be sliced into two halves like cheese.

190
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.270
Second, what can't be used for criminal purposes?

191
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.970
Even a dull knife for descaling a fish can.

192
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.610
You're right. Even a fish can be made into a weapon.

193
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.370
I handled a murder case once. You know what the murder weapon was?

194
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.770
A frozen tilapia taken out from the freezer.

195
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.346
The spines along its back were like razors.

196
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.510
You're Captain Shi Qiang, right?

197
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.380
Yes. That's me.

198
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.030
Did you ask me to the meeting just to talk about this?

199
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.130
No, no, no. Nothing to do with all that.

200
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.300
I was chatting with you and showing you around. Look.

201
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.620
This museum is enlightening.

202
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.280
It tells us that all human beings will eventually die.

203
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.610
After they die, they'll become big skeletons like this.

204
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.320
I don't agree with you. We'll be cremated after we die.

205
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.622
Also, this is a fossil.

206
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.570
Right.

207
00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:00.018
Do you think there will be sarira after scientists are cremated? 
<i>(TN: sarira's are a buddhist relic left behind after someone dies)</i>

208
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.760
Come on. Let's walk and chat.

209
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.270
Comrades, let me introduce our guests before the meeting.

210
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:18.730
This is a marine colonel of Country M in the North American Combat Zone, Mr. Stanton.

211
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.650
This is an army colonel of Country T, Mr. Mike.

212
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:32.390
Meanwhile, they are liaisons of the North American Combat Zone and the European Combat Zone.

213
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:34.320
These two comrades...

214
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.092
All these guys want is to get information out of us, but they never tell us anything.

215
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.110
As for Oceania,

216
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:51.680
- Asia... 
- I've been here for a while, and I still don't know anything, just like you.

217
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.530
...and the United Nations,

218
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.960
I won't introduce their representatives one by one.

219
00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.980
Comrades, let's get started.

220
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.110
Yes.

221
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.190
Today, Comrades.

222
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.120
- We call each other comrades here.
- I will brief all comrades

223
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.690
- Comrades. 
 - at the meeting.

224
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:16.880
Of all the combat zones around the globe, this one has become the focal point. 
 <i>[Asian Defense Council]</i>

225
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.540
Recently, the enemy has intensified the pattern of attacks.

226
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.060
Their targets remain elite scientists.

227
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:31.140
<i>Professor David, a pioneer in the detection of cosmic neutrino of Gadayork University,</i>

228
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.890
<i>committed suicide a month ago.</i>

229
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:36.360
<i>Hart, the astrophysicist of Country A, committed suicide 13 days ago.</i>

230
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.790
<i>Country T is the disaster zone of scientists' suicides.</i>

231
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.250
<i>Professor August in the field of precision spectroscopy,</i>

232
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.220
<i>Professor Bauer who engaged in nuclear structure study, and another three scientists died one after another.</i>

233
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:53.230
Recently, the number of scientists that committed suicide around the globe has increased sharply.

234
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.130
In front of you is a list of scientists that committed suicide.

235
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.986
Take a look.

236
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.540
Professor Wang,

237
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.370
as you look through these names, does anything strike you?

238
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:25.080
They are all famous scholars working at the forefront of...

239
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.588
<i>[Yang Dong]</i>

240
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.676
<i>[Yang Dong]</i>

241
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.860
You know her?

242
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.670
You don't know her, but want to know her?

243
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:58.830
All the physicists on this list have committed suicide in the last two months.

244
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.160
When did this happen?

245
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.510
Professor Wang means the last name.

246
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.330
Yang Dong, right? Yang Dong was the last to commit suicide.

247
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.750
Two nights ago, she overdosed on sleeping pills.

248
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.642
She died very peacefully. No pain.

249
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.720
Why did they do this?

250
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:28.110
The only thing we can be sure of, is that the same reason drove all of them to suicide.

251
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:36.190
Most scientists questioned in their suicide notes that physics didn't exist.

252
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.720
The document contains their suicide notes.

253
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.192
Everyone can examine them after the meeting.

254
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:48.758
Yang Dong's isn't included.

255
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.830
Dr. Ding, would you please show Yang Dong's note to Professor Wang?

256
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.210
Hers is the shortest and the most representative.

257
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.660
Thanks.

258
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.030
He was Yang Dong's boyfriend.

259
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.350
- I know. 
 - You know?

260
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:22.810
He's a famous physicist who discovered the macroatom while studying ball lightning.

261
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.030
<i>All the evidence points to a single conclusion:</i>

262
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:32.610
<i>physics has never existed, and will never exist.</i>

263
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.320
<i>I know what I'm doing is irresponsible.</i>

264
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.060
<i>But I have no choice.</i>

265
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.480
<i>Physics doesn't exist.</i>

266
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.670
Today we're discussing an organization called the Frontiers of Science.

267
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.000
According to our investigation,

268
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.140
most of the scientists who committed suicide had some connection with the organization.

269
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:06.450
Dr. Ding, since you're a theoretical physicist, can you give us more background on it?

270
00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:14.510
I have no direct connection with the Frontiers of Science, but it is famous in academia.

271
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.050
Its core goal is a response to the following: since the second half of the twentieth century,

272
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.360
physics has gradually lost the concision and simplicity of its classical theories.

273
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.810
Modern theoretical models have become more and more complex, vague, and uncertain.

274
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.380
So they want to use the methods of science to discover the limits of science,

275
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.620
to try to find out if there's a limit to how deeply and precisely science can know nature,

276
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.350
a boundary beyond which science cannot go.

277
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:43.610
But with the development of modern physics, humans seem to have touched such a line.

278
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.790
Dr. Ding, could you make it clearer?

279
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.350
I've already made it clear enough.

280
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.110
Dr. Ding,

281
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.440
sorry for your loss.

288
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.400
Let me introduce myself, Chang Weisi.

289
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.700
According to our investigation,

290
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:48.500
most of the scholars who committed suicide had some connection with the Frontiers of Science,

291
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.600
and some were even members.

292
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.900
Of course, they haven't committed any crime.

293
00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.100
We heard that they contacted you recently, right?

294
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.300
Yes.

295
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.200
They invited me to their gatherings.

296
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.800
Could you tell us more details?

297
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.900
Yeah.

298
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.200
Including the names of your contacts,

299
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.600
the times and locations of meetings,

300
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.600
the content of your conversations,

301
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.400
and if you exchanged letters or e-mails.

302
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.500
Shi, behave yourself.

303
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.400
This isn't an interrogation.

304
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.800
Professor Wang, go ahead.

305
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000
The one who invited me was Shen Yufei, a foreign physicist.

306
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.100
<i>She currently works for a foreign-invested company, researching nanotech.</i>

307
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.400
<i>We met at a technical conference. </i>
 <i>[Shen Yufei]</i>

308
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.600
<i>At the conference, she introduced a few other physicists to me,</i>

309
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.600
<i>some Chinese, some foreign.</i>

310
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.600
<i>And then?</i>

311
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.800
Then nothing.

312
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.700
We don't have many common topics.

313
00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.000
Why?

314
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.500
My work is in applied research, but they were discussing fundamental physics.

315
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.000
<i>I don't know much about theoretical matters.</i>

316
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.900
<i>So, basically, I was listening to their discussions and arguments.</i>

317
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.200
But all of them were deep thinkers with novel points of view.

318
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.100
<i>Though I was only listening, I felt that I was opening my mind.</i>

319
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.800
They didn't ask you to join them?

320
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.100
They did.

321
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.200
But my time and energy were limited, so I declined.

322
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200
Tell the truth.

323
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.200
What I said is the truth.

324
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.000
I don't need to hide anything from you.

325
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.000
If physics doesn't exist, what will happen to your nanotech?

326
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.200
I said my work was in applied research.

327
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.900
Even if physics doesn't exist, I can still carry on nano experiments.

328
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:51.300
Professor Wang, it's like this. The main reason we invited you over today is to ask you to join the organization.

329
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.700
We'd like to learn more about the internal workings of the organization through you.

330
00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.278
You mean you want me to be a mole?

331
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.800
A mole!

332
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800
What's so funny?

333
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.400
You're right.

334
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.200
We just want to know some internal information.

335
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm sorry, General.

336
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.200
I cannot do this.

337
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.600
Professor Wang. Investigating this organization is complicated.

338
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.400
For us, it's like walking across thin ice.

339
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.800
Without your support, we cannot make any progress.

340
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.200
I am very busy at work.

341
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.000
I just don't have the time.

342
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.100
I'm so sorry.

343
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.600
Thank you for coming here today.

344
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.600
I'm sorry for wasting your precious time.

345
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.400
It's better this way!

346
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.700
I disagree with the plan anyway!

347
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.800
So many bookworms have already killed themselves.

348
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.900
If we send him, he'd be a meat dumpling thrown to the dogs.

349
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.100
The way you speak is not appropriate for a good police officer.

350
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.300
I'm not a good cop anyway.

351
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.000
We don't know why these scholars killed themselves.

352
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.500
You shouldn't speak of them so contemptuously.

353
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.200
Their minds have made so many contributions to humanity.

354
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.800
They're irreplaceable.

355
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800
What do you mean?

356
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.400
You're saying they're better than me?

357
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.400
At least I wouldn't kill myself just because someone told me some bullshit.

358
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.600
Professor Wang, I have no confidence in you.

359
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.100
Not at all, really.

360
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.600
You think I would kill myself too?

361
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.300
I have to be concerned about your safety.

362
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.800
There's no need.

363
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.200
I would be much safer than you in such situations.

364
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.900
A person's ability to discern the truth is directly proportional to his knowledge.

365
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.500
I'm not sure about that.

366
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.400
A man as vulnerable as you...

367
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.600
- Shi! 
- Let him speak.

368
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.000
Maybe some people will never understand what kind of person a scientist is.

369
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.200
Anyway, I must warn you not to go to the Frontiers of Science.

370
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.800
You mustn't go to the Frontiers of Science again.

371
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.400
The dead can't be brought back to life.

372
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.800
I don't want to see anyone die again.

373
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.200
I want him to remain alive for a while.

374
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.900
Shi, get out.

375
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.600
Of course I'll stay alive.

376
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.900
But I never want to see you again.

377
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.400
Anyhow, I want to see you again.

378
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.100
That's just his personality.

379
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.700
He's actually a very experienced criminal police and anti-terrorism expert.

380
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.400
Over 20 years ago, he was a soldier in my company.

381
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.500
Given the current situation, we really need him.

382
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.800
Professor Wang, you can ask me any questions you have.

383
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:51.200
General Chang, what did everything you talked about have to do with the military?

384
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.800
War has everything to do with the army.

385
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.300
War?

386
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.700
Where is this war?

387
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.100
There aren't any hot spots in the world right now.

388
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.600
This is probably the most peaceful period in history.

389
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.500
Soon, you and everyone will know everything.

390
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.856
Do you mean that we are teetering on the brink of war?

391
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.000
Professor Wang, I have a personal question for you.

392
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.900
Have you ever had anything big happen to you before?

393
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.000
I mean something that changed your life completely,

394
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.500
like if you woke up from being asleep, and found the world had become a totally different place.

395
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.300
No.

396
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.700
Then your life has been fortunate.

397
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.900
The world is big and full of unpredictable factors,

398
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.000
yet you have never faced a crisis.

399
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.700
But that's true of most lives, isn't it?

400
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.200
Then most people have lived fortunately.

401
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.600
But many generations have lived in this plain manner.

402
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.800
All fortunate.

403
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.400
Wait, General Chang, I have to confess that I'm not feeling very sharp today.

404
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.400
- Are you suggesting that... 
 - Yes.

405
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.200
All of humankind has been fortunate.

406
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.900
From the Stone Age until now, no real crisis has ever occurred.

407
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.100
We've been very lucky.

408
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.800
But if it's all luck, then it has to come to an end one day.

409
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.400
I'm telling you now, it's ended.

410
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.400
Prepare for the worst.

411
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
- Then... 
 - The car is waiting.

412
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Goodbye, Professor Wang.

413
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.400
<i>The number of scientists that committed suicide around the globe has increased sharply.</i>

414
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.100
<i>Anyway, I must warn you not to go to the Frontiers of Science.</i>

415
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.800
<i>You mustn't go to the Frontiers of Science again.</i>

416
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.000
<i>The dead can't be brought back to life.</i>

417
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.800
<i>Her death is related to her scientific findings.</i>

418
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.600
<i>All the evidence points to a single conclusion:</i>

419
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.000
<i>physics has never existed, and will never exist.</i>

420
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.100
<i>I know what I'm doing is irresponsible.</i>

421
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.600
<i>But I have no choice.</i>

422
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.100
<i>Welcome to Sinotron II High-energy Particle Accelerator Base.</i>
<i>[10 months ago]</i>

423
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.800
Mr. Wang,

424
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.700
are you shooting the accelerator? 
 <i>[Liangxiang Accelerator Base]</i>

425
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.800
Have you checked everything?
<i>[45 minutes before the collision experiment]</i>

426
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.000
Rest assured. The nano-components our lab provided for the accelerator is perfect.

427
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.400
The accelerator will finally be put in use today.

428
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.100
Having cost more than 20 billion yuan, it's the third one in the world and the first in Asia.

429
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.800
- I never thought that such a young scientist would be in charge of its first operation. 
 - Dr. Yang Dong,

430
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.000
the results have come out already.

431
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.400
Here is the test report.

432
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.800
The Superstring Theory's collider test data.

433
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.600
Do you think this set of data is normal?

434
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.400
The three sets don't correlate.

435
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.400
But, Dr. Qian Xuesen said, the abnormal is normal.

436
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.300
But I'm curious.

437
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.500
Where did the data come from?

438
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.400
Liangxiang Accelerator Experiment Base.

439
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.500
You know, my student, Yang Dong, just started the experiment. 
<i>[Liangxiang Accelerator Base]</i>

440
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.500
It isn't finished. There are no test results. 
 <i>[15 minutes before the collision experiment[</i>

441
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.500
There's nothing in the data. Impossible.

442
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.900
So where did you get the data from?

443
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.300
Liangxiang Accelerator Experiment Base.

444
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.700
These are experiment data Yang Dong will receive today.

445
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.200
<i>Accelerate protons. Phase I.</i>

446
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.200
<i>Separate the magnetic poles to enable loading function.</i>

447
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.800
<i>Infuse particle beam.</i>

448
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.100
<i>Countdown.</i>

<i>Three.</i>

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.590
<i>Two.</i>

453
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.090
<i>One.</i>

454
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.610
<i>Particle velocity is 99% of the light velocity.</i>

455
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.668
<i>[Liangxiang Accelerator Base - Large Particle Collider]</i>

456
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.450
<i>Are the measurements correct?</i>

457
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.510
Yeah.

458
00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.070
No accuracy.

459
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.258
Miss fit of data.

460
00:31:52.258 --> 00:31:54.560
Please fax me the results.

461
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:18.919
No test results. Not accurate. And yet, you got them before.

462
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.720
Who are you?

463
00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.042
How did you get these results?

464
00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.270
Look at it.

465
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.832
It tries hard,

466
00:32:28.832 --> 00:32:33.166
climbing over bricks, over the steel,

467
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.026
the glass.

468
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.424

It thinks it couldn't get in because it hasn't found the crack on the glass yet.

470
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:52.606
It believes a crack must exist.

471

I can give it the crack.

Ding Yi is a good choice.

482
00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:45.336
First of all, he's a scientist working in fundamental physics.

483
00:34:45.336 --> 00:34:49.104
And also, he was Yang Dong's fiancÃ©.

484
00:34:49.104 --> 00:34:53.482
If he joins the Frontiers of Science, it'll be advantageous to us.

485
00:34:53.482 --> 00:34:54.978
I don't think so.

00:34:54.978 --> 00:34:57.100
Why?

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:01.250
The members of the Frontiers of Science are mostly fundamental physicists.

I've contacted him before.

495
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.732
His research is far from mass production.

496
00:35:22.732 --> 00:35:25.254
He published a paper recently,

497
00:35:25.254 --> 00:35:27.940
which mentioned nano flying blades.

498
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.608
If it really goes into mass production, it's possible.
