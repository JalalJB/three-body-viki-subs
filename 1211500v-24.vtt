18
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.280
(Both Yang Weining and Lei Zhicheng)

19
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.790
(supported me to continue my research,)

20
00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.480
(but I knew for a fact
that it had hit a dead end.)

21
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.400
(Report of Conclusion)
(In my final report,)

22
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.960
(I conceded that I failed
and couldn't solve the problem.)

23
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.750
It's been so long,

24
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.560
yet Ye Wenjie still hasn't made
much of a breakthrough.

25
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.360
It's a brand-new topic.

26
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.910
The fact that she's taking on it
counts for something.

27
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.870
I can't agree more.

28
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.470
It's highly theoretical
and proves the researcher's expertise,

29
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.280
or should we say...

30
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280
proficiency.

31
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.800
I'll give her everything she needs
to carry on with her work

32
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.680
so that we won't
let our superiors down.

33
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.520
This research means a lot to us, too.

34
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.430
Us?

35
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.080
It's you who want her to continue.

36
00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.870
Weining, I hate to say this,
but you're less insightful.

37
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.150
Now that the chaos in society
is finally subsiding,

38
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.190
new requirements are set
for cadres like us.

39
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.150
We need to be mature politically
and accomplished academically.

40
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.960
You don't want to
be stuck here forever, do you?

41
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.080
Think about your future.

42
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.030
We've been helping Ye Wenjie
with her research.

43
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.360
If she makes a breakthrough,
the credit will go to us, too.

44
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.470
I didn't think of that as long as
she can carry on her research.

45
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.590
Sure. Of course.

46
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.150
That makes the two of us.

47
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.470
Without this research project,

48
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.710
she wouldn't have indulged
in the latest academic resources.

49
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.080
I'm envious.

50
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.560
(In the end,
I didn't hand in that report.)

51
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.870
(If my research was terminated,)

52
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.800
(the base library would stop gathering
research materials)

53
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.840
(or ordering
foreign language journals.)

54
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.280
(I'd no longer gain access)

55
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.430
(to such a trove
of astrophysics references.)

56
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.680
(But I never expected
that this decision)

57
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.120
(would lead to a surprising discovery.)

58
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.390
(I continued my research as normal
on solar interference,)

59
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.480
(but actually, I was refining
my mathematical model of the sun.)

60
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.480
(After completing a set of
cumbersome matrix calculations,)

61
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.830
(a paper in a journal
about Jupiter)

62
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.390
(caught my attention.)

63
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.680
(Dr. Harry Peterson
published a set of data)

64
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.000
(accidentally obtained on June 12th
and July 2nd)

65
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.480
(while observing Jupiter's precession,)

66
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.680
(during which strong electromagnetic
radiation was detected,)

67
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360
(lasting 81 seconds)

68
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.000
(and 76 seconds, respectively.)

69
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.340
(Monitoring Main Control Room)

70
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.830
(June 12th.)

71
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.630
(July 2nd.)

72
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.360
(I remember those two dates vividly.)

73
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.830
(During those days,)

74
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.630
(Red Coast's Monitoring System
also received strong sun outages.)

75
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.430
(The two sun outages
occurred 16 minutes and 42 seconds)

76
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.160
(after the arrival)

77
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.510
(of the Jovian radio outbursts
on Earth.)

78
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.480
(That 16 minutes and 42 seconds
were critical.)

79
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.900
Hello. It's Ye Wenjie of Monitoring.

80
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.150
Contact the National
Astronomical Observatories

81

on June 12th and July 2nd.

82

83
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.380

(Jupiter)

85

(778.33 Million KM)

86
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.500
(152.7 Million KM)

87
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.260
(100 Million KM)

88
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.430
(From the distance
between Earth and Jupiter,)

89
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.920
(it's easy to figure out
the time it took)

90
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.270
(for the radio outbursts
to travel between the two.)

91
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.430
(Then calculate the time)

92
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.870
(it'd take the radio outbursts
to go from Jupiter to the sun,)

93
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.190
(and from the sun to Earth.)

94
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:56.720
(The difference between the two
was exactly 16 minutes and 42 seconds.)

95
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.040
I know I might've bored you,

96
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.870
but I feel necessary
to tell you every word of it.

97
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.160
Is such a gap related to the
sudden fluctuation of solar radiation?

98
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.870
I had my guess back in the day.

99
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.360
As you all know,

100
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.630
energy produced by reaction
within the solar core

101
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.190
is initially in the form
of high-energy gamma rays.

102
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.600
The radiation zone
absorbs these high-energy photons

103
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.870
and re-emits them.

104
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.750
Such successive absorption
and re-emission go quite a long way

105
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.080
as a photon might take 1,000 years
to leave the sun.

106
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.240
That's true.

107
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.030
After this lengthy process,
gamma rays become X-rays,

108
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.200
extreme ultraviolet, ultraviolet,

109
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.600
then eventually turn into visible light
and other forms of radiation.

110
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.390
The frequencies drop gradually.

111
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.870
You can think of it as a slow slope.

112
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.320
However,

113
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.360
my model of the sun
led to a new result.

114
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.790
As radiation dropped through
different frequencies,

115
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.630
there were boundaries
between the subzones.

116
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.790
It's like going down the stairs.

117
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.480
As energy crossed each boundary,
from inside out,

118
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.320
the radiation frequency
stepped down a grade sharply.

119
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.480
So the change in frequencies
isn't gradual?

120
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.670
That differs from the traditional view.

121
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.440
Indeed.

122
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.480
I also found
that these boundaries

123
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.960
would reflect radiation
from the lower-frequency side,

124
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.550
and I called them "energy mirrors".

125
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.240
How accurate and fascinating!

126
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.720
One of the most incredible features
of those boundary surfaces

127
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.750
is what I call "gain reflectivity".

128
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.870
My theory is
the energy mirrors not only

129
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.550
reflect radiation
from the lower-frequency side

130
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.080
but also amplify it.

131
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.510
All the mysterious sudden fluctuations

132
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.440
we observed in narrow frequency bands

133
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.440
were the result of other radiation
from space being amplified.

134
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.840
That was why we couldn't see any
disturbances on the surface of the sun.

135
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.000
But that characteristic was bizarre

136
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.080
and hard to prove

137
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:33.440
until I discovered
that critical time-frame:

138
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.320
16 minutes and 42 seconds.

139
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.030
You skipped meals again?

140
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.870
Here's Jupiter's precession
on June 12th and July 2nd,

141
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.750
and solar interference
on Earth on those days

142
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.960
from the National
Astronomical Observatories.

143
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.910
Jupiter is here, and Earth and the sun.

144
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.910
Based on
Earth's and Jupiter's positions then,

145
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.390
I calculated the distances
between the three.

146
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.870
The time for electromagnetic radiation
to reach Earth from Jupiter

147
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.000
is approximately 2,099 seconds.

148
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.270
From Jupiter to the sun
and the sun to Earth,

149
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.630
that's about 3,101 seconds.

150
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:33.630
The difference is 1,002 seconds
or 16 minutes and 42 seconds.

151
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.600
So?

152
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.440
My guess is after the Jovian
radio outbursts reached the sun,

153
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.030
they were re-emitted after being amplified
about 100 million times.

154
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.630
Earth received both sets of emissions
before and after the amplification,

155
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.870
separated by 16 minutes and 42 seconds.

156
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.550
The sun is an amplifier for radio waves!

157
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.790
But it's receiving electromagnetic radiation
from space all the time,

158
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.030
including that from the Earth.

159
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.150
Why were only some
of the waves amplified?

160
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.510
Because of the shielding effect
of the solar convection zone.

161
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.840
(Sun)

162
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.270
Situated outside the radiation zone,

163
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.060
it's the outermost
liquid layer of the sun.

164
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.060
(Solar Convection Zone)

165
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.750
(Space)
The radio waves from space

166
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.960
penetrate the convection zone first
to reach the radiation zone,

167
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.270
where they'll be amplified

168
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.910
before being reflected back out.

169
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.870
So the waves have to be more powerful
than a threshold value.

170
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.670
The vast majority
of Earth-based radio sources

171
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.630
(Earth)

172
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.840
can't cross this threshold,

173
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.550
but the Jovian radio outburst
crossed it.

174
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.820
(Jupiter)

175
00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.120
(Sun)

176
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.360
Red Coast's maximum transmission power

177
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.720
exceeds it, too.

178
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.340
(Space, Radiation Zone, Sun)

179
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.600
Will this solve solar interference?

180
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.000
Not really,

181
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.080
but an exciting possibility ensues.

182
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.080
That humans can use the sun
as a super-antenna,

183
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.910
and through it,
broadcast radio waves to the universe.

184
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:04.670
The waves will be sent
with the power of the sun,

185
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.320
hundreds of millions of times greater
than the total usable transmission power

186
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.480
on Earth.

187
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.870
Are you saying

188
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.360
Earth can transmit

189
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.480
at the level of
a Kardashev Type II civilization?

190
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.390
Correct.

191
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.960
Once we compare the waveforms
of the two Jovian radio outbursts

192
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.030
with the waveforms of the sun outages

193
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.080
received by Red Coast
and they're a match,

194
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.980
that'll be
further confirmation of my theory.

195
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.960
What do you need?

196
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.440
Contact Dr. Harry Peterson
to obtain the waveform records

197
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.580
of the two Jovian radio outbursts.

198
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.240
That won't be easy.

199
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.540
For one, we lack a proper channel,
and two,

200
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.150
we need approval at all levels.

201
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.720
Any lapse

202
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.480
could lead to treason.

203
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.120
I'll see what I can do.

204
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.150
There's a...

205
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200
There's a shortcut.

206
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.790
I'm listening.

207
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.120
Red Coast can transmit radio waves
directly at the sun

208
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.080
at a power level
above the threshold value.

209
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.630
No way.

210
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.200
That's never been done in our country.

211
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.840
I doubt Political Commissar Lei
would agree to it.

212
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.030
I'll tell him
it's for my solar research.

213
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.360
Use our transmission system
as a solar exploration radar

214
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.670
whose echoes can be analyzed
to obtain

215
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.150
some information about solar radiation.

216
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.480
There are such precedents in the West.

217
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.270
In fact, it's technically easier

218
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.000
than the radar exploration
of terrestrial planets

219
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.360
already being conducted.

220
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.560
Given Lei's technical background,
he won't be fooled.

221
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.630
It's worth a try.

222
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.660
(Solar Electromagnetic Radiation
Monitored by Red Coast)

223
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.550
Ye Wenjie,
you're getting out of line!

224
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.630
Theoretical research is enough.

225
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:44.240
Why go to such great lengths?

226
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.630
Lei, as you know,

227
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.720
all major discoveries
must be confirmed by experiments.

228
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.750
If her theory is proven right,

229
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.080
that'll be unprecedented!

230
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120
Just this once,

231
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.400
please.

232
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400
Yes.

233
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.830
Try it once.

234
00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:08.160
It's not too difficult.

235
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.790
Receiving the echoes after transmission

236
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.550
will only take...

237
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.240
A little over ten minutes.

238
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.000
That's right!

239
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.030
Enough for Red Coast to switch from
transmission to monitoring mode.

240
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.880
I know it's feasible
technically and operationally.

241
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:26.720
You just don't get it, do you?

242
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.830
Aiming a super-powerful
radio beam at the sun?

243
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.960
Have you thought about
the potential danger and risk?

244
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.310
I have to review every report
before handing it in.

245
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.590
Everything related to the sun
must be double-checked!

246
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.810
There's uncertainty
about this experiment.

247
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:06.120
Great uncertainty,
you know?

248
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.140
(Research Report)

249
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.510
Keep working on solar interference.

250
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.790
Forget about this experiment.

251
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.240
Political Commissar Lei's refusal

252
00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.310
is beyond reasonable.

253
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.720
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.640
I wish I could help.

255
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.000
It's for your sake.

256
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.160
Let it go.

257
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.480
(But I didn't listen to him.)

258
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.790
(Finally, sparks of hope
were rekindled after so long.)

259
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.200
(I couldn't see them go out like this.)

260
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.690
(I kept looking for a chance
to pull off the experiment.)

261
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.110
(Actually,)

262
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:15.240
(the risk wasn't too high
to get it done.)

263
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.030
(Red Coast's transmitter
was ultra-high-powered.)

264
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.440
(The fault rate was high.)

265
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.880
(After each overhaul,
there'd be a test transmission.)

266
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.640
Engineer Zhang,
something is wrong again.

267
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.310
It keeps happening.

268
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:43.550
I just finished the overhaul yesterday.

269
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.240
Not again!

270
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.270
I'll do it.

271
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.160
Thank you,

272
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.830
Wenjie.

273
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.110
(I adjusted the test transmission power
to exceed the threshold value)

274
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.550
(for my gain-reflective theory)

275
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.310
(and then set the frequency)

276
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:27.480
(to the value most likely
to be amplified by the energy mirror.)

277
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.880
(Finally,
under the guise of testing the antenna,)

278
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.480
(I aimed it at the setting sun)

279
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.160
(and transmitted the same content
as usual.)

280
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.920
Hey...

281
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.270
Tell...

282
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.000
Tell the base station
to monitor the 12,000 MHz channel.

283
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.270
What are we receiving?

284
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.880
Maybe we'll get something.

285
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.370
There's no time to change the system
to monitoring mode.

286
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.750
This is Yang Weining.

287
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.680
Monitor the 12,000 MHz channel.

288
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.440
Keep me updated.

289
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.240
Wait!

290
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.550
Given the low sensitivity of that radio,

291
00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:26.720
we can only receive signals
from extraterrestrials on the moon.

292
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.680
The signal comes from...

293
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.720
the sun.

294
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.880
You used Red Coast
to send a signal to the sun?

295
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.240
Do not tell anyone else about it.
It can't happen again.

296
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.400
Never!

297
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.350
What's the point anyway?

298
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.750
Even if there's an echo wave,

299
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:27.720
it'll be too weak
to be picked up by our radio.

300
00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.000
No.

301
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.270
If my guess is right,

302
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.830
it'll receive an extremely strong echo,

303
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.480
more powerful than we can imagine.

304
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.310
As long as the transmission power
exceeds a certain threshold,

305
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:53.480
the sun can amplify
the signal 100 million-fold.

306
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.790
I see.

307
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.440
They got nothing.

308
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.000
Don't be too upset.

309
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.830
Check this out.

310
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.030
That astronomer

311
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.110
wrote back.

312
00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.240
What did he say?

313
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.920
He said he hadn't imagined

314
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.110
that there'd be fellows in China
studying planetary electromagnetism

315
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.830
and expected more collaboration
and communication.

316
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.680
(The two stacks of paper he sent
included a complete record)

317
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.880
(of the waveforms
of the two Jovian radio outbursts.)

318
00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.720
(I lined them up on the floor.)

319
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.440
(If they match
that of the two sun outages,)

320
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.440
(that means my theory is right.)

321
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:02.720
(Halfway through the effort,
I gave up any hope.)

322
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.400
(I knew those two waveforms by heart.)

323
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.830
(They didn't match these two.)

324
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.750
What's wrong?

325
00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.590
Nothing.

326
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:31.590
It's time to
wake up from my dream.

327
00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.310
(Little did I know that at that moment,)

328
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.790
(the first cry that could be heard)

329
00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.480
(in space from Earth civilization)

330
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.320
(had been spreading out from the sun)

331
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:17.030
(to the universe at the speed of light.)

332
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:43.480
(A star-powered radio wave,
like a majestic tide,)

333
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.760
(had crossed the orbit of Jupiter.)

334
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.550
(At the frequency of 12,000 MHz,)

335
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:55.890
(the sun was the brightest star
in the entire Milky Way.)

336
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.000
Your call to the universe

337
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.800
let Lord finally hear us!

338
00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.280
Eliminate human tyranny!

339
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.150
The world belongs to Trisolaris!

340
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.230
Eliminate human tyranny!

341
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.960
The world belongs to Trisolaris!

342
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.230
Eliminate human tyranny!

343
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:22.190
The world belongs to Trisolaris!

344
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.510
At the time,
I couldn't have imagined that.

345
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:39.840
That transmission
was more of a gorgeous bubble.

346
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.030
It quickly broke

347
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:46.190
and my life returned to peace.

348
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:53.110
(The Red Coast Project completed its testing
and breaking-in phases.)

349
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:58.280
(Technical problems became
fewer and fewer.)

350
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.440
(Four years after I came to the base,)

351
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.360
(Happy Marriage)
(Yang Weining married me)

352
00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.840
(at the cost of his future career.)

353
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.960
(Due to my complicated background,
he lost his position as chief engineer.)

354
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.550
(We stayed on the base)

355
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.000
(as ordinary technicians.)

356
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.360
(My life and work became regular)

357
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.960
(and I gained inner peace.)

358
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.110
(That said,)

359
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:05.670
(what had been suppressed
by anxiety and fear)

360
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.920
(began to awaken.)

361
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.480
(I started to look with a rational gaze)

362
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.800
(at the madness and hatred
that had harmed me)

363
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.840
(and straight at humanity's evil side.)

364
00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.480
(I read classics of
foreign-language philosophy and history.)

365
00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.710
(Philosophers' extraordinary insights)

366
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.550
(led me to the most fundamental)

367
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.840
(and secret aspects of human nature.)

368
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.840
(In reality,
the irrationality of the human race)

369
00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.550
(was constantly on display.)

370
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:17.630
(Deranged logging
was found every day everywhere.)

371
00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:22.880
(Wasteland kept growing day by day.)

372
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.630
(The insanity of the human race)

373
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:29.070
(had reached its historical zenith.)

374
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.480
(Back then,)

375
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.960
(the Cold War was at its height.)

376
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.000
(Under the ground
were countless missile silos.)

377
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.630
(Under the sea,)

378
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:48.960
(nuclear submarines
were patrolling like ghosts.)

379
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.070
(Nuclear warfare
able to destroy Earth dozens of times)

380
00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:55.070
(might break out at any moment.)

381
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.920
(A single Lafayette)

382
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.280
(or Yankee-class submarine
held enough warheads)

383
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.840
(to destroy hundreds of cities)

384
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.510
(and kill hundreds of millions
of people.)

385
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:13.920
(Nuclear Weapons
are as powerful as stars.)

386
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.360
(But the universe
has even more terrible forces)

387
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:25.320
(such as black holes, anti-matter,
dark matter, and more.)

388
00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.670
(Compared with them,)

389
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:33.070
(a thermonuclear bomb is nothing
but a tiny candle.)

390
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.150
(If humans obtained
one of those other forces,

391
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:43.070
(the world
might be vaporized instantly.)

392
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:48.750
In the presence of madness,
rationality is powerless.

393
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:55.590
(I remember
I was battling the loss of purpose.)

394
00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:58.150
(I had been an idealist)

395
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:03.840
(who'd give it her all for a great cause.)

396
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.480
(But then, I found all that I had done
was meaningless,)

397
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:17.590
as would any future endeavor be.

398
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:23.030
Until 1979,

399
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.670
on October 21st,

400
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.220
everything was changed.

401
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:41.030
(Actually, the night shift was easy.)

402
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.070
(I just needed to check
the waves of radio signals from space)

403
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:49.070
(and listen to the meaningless noise.)

404
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:05.110
(It was hard to tell with the naked eye
if a waveform carried information.)

405
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.190
(But I was so familiar with the waveform)
(of the noise of the universe.)

406
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.840
(I realized
the wave moving in front of me)

407
00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.710
(had been modulated by intelligence.)

408
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:23.710
(No radio signals we had received
exceeded C-level recognizability.)

409
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.670
(Were it an A, the likelihood that the
transmission contained intelligent information)

410
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:33.470
(would be above 90 percent.)

411
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:39.000
(The rating of that one was AAAAA.)

412
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.320
(That was extremely unusual,)

413
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.230
(which meant
that the received transmission)

414
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:50.840
(used the same coding language
as Red Coast's outbound transmission.)

415
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.980
(Do not answer)

416
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:18.320
