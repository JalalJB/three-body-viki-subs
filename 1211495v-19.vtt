<i>- Hello?</i>

11
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.670
Where are you? Why weren't you answering your phone?

12
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.220
Just now I was out of cell range.

13
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.190
I think I'll get to the village entrance in a minute.

14
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.120
Alright. I'll wait for you at the village entrance.

15
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.630
Okay.

16
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190
Chang has gotten access to the files of Red Coast.

17
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.360
Do you know the purpose of Red Coast Base?

18
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.710
To search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

19
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.840
Simply put, to look for aliens.

20
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.470
You knew it?

21
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.150
Yeah.

22
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.750
Chang has shared this information with other Combat Zones.

23
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.460
He also pulled their files about their search

24
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.420
for extraterrestrial intelligence in recent years.

25
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.190
Where's Ye Wenjie?

26
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.560
She said she wanted to stay here for a while, reminisce about the past,

27
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.350
and visit her old friends while she's at it.

28
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.570
The old lady's surprisingly poised. What about her relations with Shen Yufei?

29
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.360
According to Qi Jianguo, they didn't have many dealings.

30
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.680
And her red ginseng?

31
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.630
That was a gift from the villagers.

32
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.430
Professor Ye has nothing to do with the red ginseng factory.

33
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.240
What about you? Did you find anything about the factory?

34
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520
Shen Yufei's just an adviser working for the foreign company.

35
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.860
She periodically comes here to check the fruits of development before acceptance.

36
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.000
She seems to be in a hurry. She's already left.

37
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.080
Outwardly, there's nothing suspicious.

38
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.970
But I don't believe it.

39
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.740
I don't believe it's so coincidental.

40
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.260
But I have no way to arrest her or interrogate her.

41
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.310
Let's go.

42
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.510
Where to?

43
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.360
Home. To do some research about Red Coast.

44
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.680
Can we have some rest first?

45
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.510
Is it possible to have them send that chopper here to pick us up?

46
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.000
Do I look like a chopper to you?

47
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.700
Just now you said Ye Wenjie wanted to visit some old friends.

48
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.360
What kind of old friends?

49
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.100
Given that she lived here for so many years. She probably has a lot of friends.

50
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.480
Old friends.

51
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.920
In your description,

52
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.780
Red Coast was made of harsh cold steel.

53
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.410
I always thought this place was a forest of concrete.

54
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.730
But the sight of it makes me feel

55
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.180
it has something warm about it.

56
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.700
That's because it's abandoned.

57
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.190
It's old.

58
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:57.100
Anything that has lost its power
and is dying

59
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.340
tends not to put people on the defensive.

60
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.540
I feel like a pilgrim here.

61
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.730
Like a believer who finally made it to Jerusalem.

62
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.840
This is where it all started.

63
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.170
As the Buddha puts it, it's predestined bonding.

64
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.190
Long time no see, Commander.

65
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.030
You don't have to call me that.

66
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.920
The Commander's status is untouchable.

67
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.770
To me, to ETO, you're our spiritual leader.

68
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.580
You'll always be the supreme commander of ETO.

69
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.620
When I was all alone in this world,

70
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.120
with nowhere to find any spiritual assistance,

71
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.360
when I was even too helpless to understand the meaning of life,

72
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.000
even the meaning of despair was beyond me.

73
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.800
Whenever such greatness appeared,

74
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.390
I saw how small and despicable we were,

75
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.610
that lives were worthy of respect and sacrifice,

76
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.820
that everything changed.

77
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.720
Then a door opened, and a new road appeared.

78
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.870
You were the one who lit that lamp, Commander.

79
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.680
Only you pushed

80
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.000
the button to contact Lord.

81
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.260
Pushing a button is just an insignificant movement.

82
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:10.160
Many major changes in human history were triggered by an insignificant movement.

83
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.500
Stefan Zweig even picked some stories and made a book out of them.

84
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.380
Decisive Moments in History.

85
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.260
But they're different from you.

86
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.660
You didn't do it by accident.

87
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.030
You made a choice.

88
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.870
Even the achievements of all outstanding humans combined

89
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.030
stand no comparison with the great decision you made.

90
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.410
What really established a communication mechanism with Lord

91
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.350
was your Second Red Coast.

92
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.540
It's our Second Red Coast.

93
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.720
(19 years ago)

94
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.520
You named it the Second Red Coast?

95
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.240
Yeah.

96
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.150
Red Coast is a great name.

97
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.170
What is this place?

98
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.450
Judgment Day.

99
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.030
Three years ago,

100
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.740
you gave me the direction and frequency required for contacting Lord.

101
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.170
Otherwise the Second Red Coast would never have been built.

102
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.850
Contacting Lord will take a long time.

103
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.440
Yeah.

104
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.110
Our lives are too short.

105
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.930
Fortunately, you gave me and ETO a chance.

106
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.270
Commander, if you didn't choose me,

107
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.100
I would never be able to communicate with Lord.

108
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:27.960
At that time, in front of the first batch of ETO members,

109
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.080
you said our ideal was to invite Lord to reform human civilization,

110
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.860
to curb human madness and evilness, so that

111
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:44.150
the Earth can once again become a harmonious, prosperous, sinless world.

112
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.650
Yeah.

113
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.100
But now everything has changed.

114
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.000
You disagree with me,

115
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.360
because you haven't seen the true colors of mankind.

116
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.150
Everything you did was based on love.

117
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.790
You love mankind.

118
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.940
You love the earth.

119
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:21.100
Even becoming the Commander was your move to keep ETO from losing control.

120
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.450
There's too little I can do.

121
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.510
I looked into you.

122
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.160
I even read your father's books.

123
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:39.520
I found that in this aspect, you're greatly influenced by your father.

124
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.040
Because of your great sense of responsibility, no matter how much harm you suffer,

125
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.950
you'll never give up the last bit of hope.

126
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.670
You can't bear to part from the splendid human civilization,

127
00:11:52.670 --> 00:12:00.850
but has it ever occurred to you that the evil of humanity is imperishable?

128
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.610
Even I, your very first follower, has betrayed you.

129
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.130
Commander, humans are absolutely incorrigible.

130
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.510
Actually,

131
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.530
you didn't have to come here to see me.

132
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.740
I know you're still trying to get information about Lord.

133
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.840
You even rebuilt the reception system.

134
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.440
It's right here.

135
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.960
This used to be the great Red Coast.

136
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.550
I never thought you'd build a new Red Coast

137
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.770
on the ruins of the abandoned one.

138
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.240
I think we should call it the Third Red Coast.

139
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.120
Did you change the reception and transmission methods?

140
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.820
Or have you been fabricating it this whole time?

141
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.240
Lord is coming.

142
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.130
Who am I to fabricate that?

143
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:15.200
I think it's merciful to let humans destroy themselves.

144
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.840
Only humans will be destroyed.

145
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.270
This world will be changed.

146
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.250
Commander,

147
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:31.130
has there ever been any mercy in the history of human civilization?

148
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.590
Evans, you still have a choice.

149
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:47.840
Compared with the universe, anything is insignificant.

150
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.320
I don't want to make any pointless choices.

151
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.430
Humans are trapped in an inferno, unable to get out.

152
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:06.320
And you were the one who started the fire.

153
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.660
Thank you, Commander.

154
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.170
I started the fire,

155
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.990
but I can't keep it under control.

156
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.670
According to the archives, the Red Coast Base was built in 1968,

157
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.030
and abandoned in 1987.

158
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.720
During the 20 years of its service,

159
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.870
no abnormal radio wave from the space was detected.

160
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.480
So they didn't find any aliens.

161
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.340
For now, that's one way to put it.

162
00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.510
For now?

163
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.060
Yeah.

164
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.510
Because the universe is vast,

165
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.910
and there are many kinds of interference in it,

166
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.750
which makes the traveling speed of the radio wave seem very slow.

167
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.750
And the longer the distance, the weaker the signal.

168
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.080
But we can't say for sure no aliens have received our radio waves.

169
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.120
There are so many archives here.

170
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.480
Are there any details that don't tally with Ye Wenjie's words?

171
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.550
What Professor Ye told me was mainly about the true purpose of Red Coast.

172
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.030
It accords with the archives almost perfectly.

173
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.550
If at that time the whole world was looking for aliens,

174
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.860
was it really necessary to make it that confidential?

175
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.670
I asked Professor Ye the same question.

176
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.080
She gave me an explanation.

177
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.380
There's some information about it in the archives as well.

178
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.670
Have you guys ever heard of Bill Mathers's "contact as symbol" theory?

179
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.870
What?

180
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.080
What? What? What?

181
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.820
I'll put it in a simple way.

182
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:08.090
It means contact with an alien civilization is only a symbol or a switch.

183
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.200
Regardless of the content of the encounter, the results would be the same.

184
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.000
The impact would be magnified by the lens of human mass psychology and culture

185
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.850
until it resulted in huge, substantive influences on the progress of civilization.

186
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.910
If such contact were monopolized by one country

187
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.790
or political force, the significance would be comparable

188
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.220
to an overwhelming advantage in economic and military power.

189
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.320
You can't understand?

190
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.550
It's not that.

191
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.750
Actually, what you said was not difficult to understand.

192
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.810
It's just that your wording and your way of speakingâ€¦ Iâ€¦

193
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.050
It means making contact with an alien civilization is like getting a book about superb martial arts.

194
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:52.480
Whoever gets it and learns the skills will become invincible.

195
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.240
Captain Shi, that's what you mean, right?

196
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.270
That's exactly what I mean. Clear and easy to understand.

197
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.390
- Professor Wang, you made it sound complicated.
- It's my bad.

198
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.240
It's like all martial artists are fighting for a martial arts book,

199
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.400
throwing the martial arts world into chaos.

200
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.740
If you're right, once anybody gets in touch with aliens, the world will be changed.

201
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.780
Chang also said those foreign terrorists used to be pacifists.

202
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.500
There're also those scientists who committed suicide.

203
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.790
They all changed without warning.

204
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.920
Was it because they made contact with aliens?

205
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:30.580
Professor Ye also said the search for alien civilization is a very special subject.

206
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.250
It has a strong influence on the researchers' outlook on life.

207
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.020
Professor Ye. 
 <i>[Astrophysicist]</i>

208
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.240
Professor Ye is indeed quite special.

209
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.030
Xu Bingbing, did the ten of you find anything else?

210
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.160
Overall, the infosheets about Red Coast correspond with Professor Wang's words,

211
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.200
but I don't know if you've noticed these details.

212
00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.100
Yang Weining and Ye Wenjie registered their marriage in 1973.

213
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.160
(Personnel Who Died in Line of Duty)
And here.

214
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.940
(Lei Zhicheng, Yang Weining,
Oct 21, 1979)

215
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.270
(Mountaintop platform Dropped to his death)

216
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.270
Lei Zhicheng

217
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.730
and Ye Wenjie's husband Yang Weining both died in the Red Coast?

218
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.790
On the same day.

219
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.720
Professor Ye.

220
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.490
Professor Ye is way too special.

221
00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.590
(Astrophysicist, Ye Wenjie)

222
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.810
I know your research and study about alien civilization are state secrets of your countries.

223
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:54.590
I'm very grateful to you for sharing them to let us analyze them together.

224
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.070
Unfortunately, none of our searches have been turned to any results.

225
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.830
The signals from space are just static.

226
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.510
It's just the natural noises of the planets.

227
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.000
This is why we cannot accept it call.

228
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.830
That's what we can call the miracle from another civilization.

229
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.400
The original conjectures of the Global Battle Command Center

230
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.590
also include the possibility it was aliens' doing,

231
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.240
but this is what we're most unwilling to admit.

232
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:27.640
If they are indeed alien civilization from outer space, how do we respond?

233
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.240
We're not prepared for that.

234
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.110
To this space civilization,

235
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.100
we're like 16th-century aboriginal Americans,

236
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.480
watching the Spanish armada come over the horizon.

237
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.210
There's nothing we can do.

238
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.350
I've still got so many Red Coast infosheets to read. Why did you bring me so many more?

239
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.880
Do you want me to look into nanotech or not?

240
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.030
You need to do both, and do them well.

241
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.960
Xu Bingbing sifted out these infosheets.

242
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.540
Red Coast didn't find any aliens. See if any other countries did.

243
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.200
After reading these infosheets, I found there were indeed a couple of occasions

244
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.110
when the radio frequencies were abnormal.

245
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.880
Abnormal how?

246
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.070
But it's absolutely impossible.

247
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.960
Look, take this one for example.

248
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.680
It's too far away from us.

249
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.280
If it was really aliens trying to contact us, a round trip would take them billions of years.

250
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.960
There's no telling if the earth would still be there by that time.

251
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.590
Is it possible they can travel really fast?

252
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.160
Just like those in the movies.

253
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.590
Faster than light.

254
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.200
If they could travel at light speed, why would they send radio signals?

255
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.020
Just like you. You got a cellphone.

256
00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.400
Will you still use a carrier pigeon?

257
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.590
Well, could it be that they were trying to reach a neighbor,

258
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.250
and we accidentally received the signal?

259
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.440
This signal was so strong.

260
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.720
It's like knocking on a neighbor's door with an atomic bomb.

261
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.000
Are you saying there are absolutely no aliens?

262
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.350
There are no aliens we can understand.

263
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.250
So you're saying there are aliens we cannot understand?

264
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.240
What's wrong?

265
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.280
Why are you so impatient?

266
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.640
If they exist, where are they?

267
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.960
This is indeed a classic question in astronomy.

268
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960
Astronomy?

269
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.980
Has Professor Ye come back?

270
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.410
- How about you consult her again?
- What are you doing?

271
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.440
You want me to look into her for you again? No.

272
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.960
If you want it done, do it yourself.

273
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.620
Scientific mettle. This is scientific mettle, Professor Wang.

274
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.980
If you, a scientist, have no scientific mettle, how can you expect me, a cop, to have any?

275
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.580
You have it.

276
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.440
Professor Ye has come back only this morning.

277
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.270
I can't visit her in the afternoon. It feels wrong.

278
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.550
This is how you display your strong thirst for knowledge.

279
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:45.000
What am I supposed to ask her?

280
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.920
Surely I can't ask her how Yang Weining died.

281
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.140
Just ask her if aliens really exist or not.

282
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.160
If they made any discoveries in the Red Coast Base,

283
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.680
it's unnecessary for her to conceal them from me.

284
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.960
Only Professor Ye knows if that's necessary.

285
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.000
If they made no discoveries whatsoever,

286
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.960
then how come these oddities led us to the subject of alien civilization?

287
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.070
Why didn't they tell us the Black and White Death Envoys were real?

288
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.880
Is it really that important?

289
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.480
It is.

290
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.590
It's very important.

291
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.540
Lately, I've read many famous astronomy books.

292
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.830
I find that the Fermi paradox is really pretty interesting.

293
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.550
It's such a big universe. How can we be alone?

294
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:40.370
But if there are aliens, where are they?

295
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.130
When the Fermi paradox was first developed,

296
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.730
it wasn't taken seriously.

297
00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.410
As our searches for alien civilization turned out to be unfruitful,

298
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:58.610
the Fermi paradox gained attention again,

299
00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.440
and it sparked more and more speculations.

300
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.000
For example, the Rare Earth Hypothesis.

301
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.130
It says aliens don't exist, that the earth is special.

302
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.710
It's the only planet with intelligent life.

303
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.960
Another hypothesis focuses on science and technology.

304
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.240
It says aliens exist,

305
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.550
but alien civilization is far more developed than human civilization,

306
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.720
or far less developed than it, so they're unable to contact us.

307
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.580
There's another one.

308
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.540
It's about radio silence.

309
00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.960
I saw that as well.

310
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.230
It says all aliens chose to keep silent.

311
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.930
For some reason.

312
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.610
There are many similar hypotheses.

313
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:04.500
But none of them can verify whether alien civilization exists.

314
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.830
Which one of those hypotheses
do you support?

315
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:15.160
I've been doing scientific research for more than half of my life.

316
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:21.040
I advocate thought experiments, but suspect everything.

317
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.380
Wang,

318
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.540
aren't you the same?

319
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:44.270
Professor Ye didn't answer your question at all.

320
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:45.510
She did.

321
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.510
She said she advocated thought experiments but suspected everything.

322
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.900
What's the matter? You find this answer unsatisfactory?

323
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.640
Suspecting everything is an attitude.

324
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.610
When you scientists do research, you have to pick a direction first, right?

325
00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:58.960
Take Newton for example.

326
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.450
He believed light was a group of particles,

327
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.540
but Huygens believed light was a wave,

328
00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.450
so they were both trying to prove their opinions in the directions they picked. Right?

329
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.580
You know about the wave-particle duality?

330
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.880
How can I not know it?

331
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.790
What books have you read lately?

332
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.920
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

333
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.030
What?

334
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.790
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

335
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.790
Will you please articulate?

336
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:30.350
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

337
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.900
What's the matter?

338
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.200
The astronomy and geography volume.

339
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.400
Don't laugh.

340
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.650
Ye Wenjie clearly evaded your question.

341
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.550
Did she not want to answer it? Or she couldn't answer it?

342
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:42.830
How am I supposed to know?

343
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.110
That's why we need to keep investigating Ye Wenjie.

344
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.860
- Hello? 
 - <i>Are you responsible for looking into Wei Cheng?</i>

345
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.310
Captain Shi, this is indeed against the rules,

346
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:24.960
but General Chang made it very clear, so we had to spare the room for him.

347
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.450
Why is he doing calculations here?

348
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.600
This guy's pretty weird.

349
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.600
He brought a pile of infosheets and a computer here, and said he wanted to report a crime,

350
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.960
but he spoke for quite a while without making himself understood.

351
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.830
And then he started doing calculations here.

352
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.860
We rushed him, but he said he'd pay us.

353
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.090
He took this place for a hotel.

354
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.030
Can we go inside and talk to him?

355
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.210
You can't.

356
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.610
Just now he emphasized that you two have to wait for another four hours.

357
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:40.260
It's been five hours.

358
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.300
If he doesn't come out right now, I'll go in and unplug his computer.

359
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.480
I'm asking you a question.

360
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.070
Do it.

361
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.480
Unplug it.

362
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.590
If I unplug it, then he won't be able to figure it out, right?

363
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.330
You're such a quick-tempered guy. Why do you care?

364
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.160
Captain Shi, you guys may go in now.

365
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.790
But that guy wants you to bring him some booze.

366
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.510
Captain Shi, who is he? Why is he so cocky?

367
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.490
Booze? Good.

368
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.030
Him wanting booze is good news. It means he made a breakthrough.

369
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:24.790
Tell me.

370
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:28.840
Staying at home is so comfortable. Why did you come here?

371
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.410
Long story.

372
00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.160
How about we do some celebrating first?

373
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.740
Don't. If you do that, we won't be able to talk until tomorrow.

374
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.510
Come on. Tell us.

375
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.460
Tell us how many steps have you taken?

376
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.650
I've built a model.

377
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.410
Can the model solve the Three-Body problem?

378
00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.240
That needs verifying.

379
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.640
This is such a crucial juncture.

380
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.110
Did you specially come to the Public Security Bureau to finish it?

381
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.210
Because someone threatened me.

382
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.410
This is the safest place.

383
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.650
Threatened you?

384
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.870
- Who? 
 - If I'm to tell you that,

385
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.050
I'll have to start from the beginning.

386
00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.640
Today I feel a bit weary.

387
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.720
If you guys really want to hear it,

388
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.890
I might need to shift into a comfortable position and take my time.

389
00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.210
Go ahead. Find yourself a comfortable position.

390
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.160
Tell us.

391
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.080
Sorry.

392
00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.160
It all started when I was in high school.

393
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.640
No, no, no. Skip the high school part.

394
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.070
High school is way off-topic.

395
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.350
No.

396
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.020
If I don't go off-topic,

397
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.510
I'm afraid you guys won't be able to understand.

398
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.000
Well, go ahead.

399
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.880
It all started when I was in high school.

400
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.840
<i>[The number of arrays]</i>

401
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.020
<i>You have one hour.</i>

402
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.780
<i>Can you work it out?</i>

403
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.100
<i>[Minimum]</i>

404
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.030
<i>And the derivation process?</i>

405
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.060
<i>The derivation processâ€¦</i>

406
00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.680
<i>I don't know.</i>

407
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.890
<i>You deduced too fast.</i>

408
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.160
<i>And you did it instinctively.</i>

409
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.400
<i>So even you yourself cannot perceive it.</i>

410
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.370
<i>Just like it's difficult for people to explain how they deduce two plus two is four.</i>

411
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.760
<i>What are numbers in your eyes?</i>

412
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.590
<i>Solid figures.</i>

413
00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.000
<i>What about geometric shapes?</i>

414
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.150
<i>They're numbers.</i>

415
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.620
<i>You have a mathematical talent.</i>

416
00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.650
<i>Butâ€¦</i>

417
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:49.550
<i>But people like you will never appreciate your talents.</i>

418
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.260
My teacher was right.

419
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.960
I don't know how to appreciate myself.

420
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.648
I was shiftless when I was an undergraduate, graduate, and doctor.  
 <i>[Legend of the Flying Fox]</i>

421
00:32:01.648 --> 00:32:04.400
Surprisingly, I managed to muddle through.

422
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.500
Afterward I became a college teacher, but still couldn't pull myself together.

423
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.400
I wrote the words "easy to prove" on the blackboard,

424
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.240
but my students couldn't figure it out no matter how hard they tried.

425
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.440
We waited for you for almost five hours

426
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.500
not to hear you brag to us or tell us you're a genius.

427
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.790
You're wrong.

428
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.860
I'm no genius.

429
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.790
I'm a good-for-nothing.

430
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:34.160
Except for maths, I can't do anything properly.

431
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.210
My life's getting worse and worse.

432
00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.170
Suddenly, one day, I got tired of all that,

433
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.780
so I packed some stuff and went to a temple.

434
00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.860
You became a Buddhist monk?

435
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.820
Weren't you married?

436
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.260
You're wrong again.

437
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.380
I couldn't be bothered to become a monk.

438
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.260
I just wanted a quiet place where I could blow off some steam.

439
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.370
An old friend of my father's lived there.

440
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.830
He was very knowledgeable, but when he got old, he became a monk.

441
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.380
According to my father,

442
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.920
people like him

443
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.480
had no other choice.

444
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.780
<i>No. I'm sorry.</i>

445
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.410
<i>Stop pretending.</i>

446
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.610
<i>Is this necessary?</i>

447
00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.680
<i>I'm trying to understand Buddhism.</i>

448
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.650
<i>Talking about Buddhism with a guy like you?</i>

449
00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.030
<i>That's pointless.</i>

450
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:05.740
<i>Come with me.</i>

451
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.590
You may live here.

452
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.800
Actually, I don't care where I live.

453
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.670
I just want to find a quiet place

454
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.640
to fiddle around for the rest of my life.

455
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.590
This place is not quiet.

456
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.760
There are many people coming and going.

457
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.000
The safest hideout is the crowd.

458
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.290
If you want quietness, you have to empty yourself.

459
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:08.380
Flush.

460
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.760
How can I make myself emptier?

461
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.900
Fame and wealth are less than nothing to me.

462
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.550
Come over here.

463
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.190
Come here.

464
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.190
Look.

465
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.150
What is this?

466
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.700
Isn't it just a radio?

467
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.480
- May I ask why it doesn't have an antenna?
- You geek.

468
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.230
It's Bluetooth-enabled.

469
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.030
Bluetooth?

470
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.920
Is this a radio?

471
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.220
This is an amplifier.

472
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.280
Is this a radio?

473
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.780
This is a transistor.

474
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:22.110
This is a capacitor.

475
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.130
Where's the radio?

476
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.860
Gone.

477
00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:39.070
So radio is just a temporary pseudonym we gave these components.

478
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:43.550
If you dismantle it in your mind, it'll cease to exist.

479
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.700
Therefore, radio is not a permanent entity.

480
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.590
These things can become a radio or a pile of components.

481
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.030
This process is emptying.

482
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.480
What does "Form is emptiness" means?

483
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:06.920
If you're right, then form is only a process.

484
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.200
Form means everything you can see.

485
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.320
Emptiness is not nothingness.

486
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:21.630
You need to fill yourself with emptiness.

487
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.630
I couldn't sleep that night,

488
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:54.000
so I kept pondering over Professor Han's remark.

489
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.260
I never thought the never-never land
would be so uncomfortable.

490
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.650
My sheets were very damp due to the mountain mist.

491
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:04.670
And the bed was very hard.

492
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.130
It made it difficult for me to sleep.

493
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:13.830
To get to sleep, I tried doing as Professor Han said.

494
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.950
Filling myself with emptiness.

495
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:28.450
Can you guys understand?

496
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.830
Go on.

497
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.450
In my mind, I created the first "emptiness".

498
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:28.260
It's a boundless space.

499
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.400
There's nothing in it, not even light.

500
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.320
Absolutely empty.

501
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:45.000
Soon I realized that the empty universe couldn't calm me down.

502
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:50.800
Being in there made me feel inexplicably anxious.

503
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.250
Like someone drowning in a river who's trying to grab something within reach.

504
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.070
So

505
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:03.000
I created a sphere for myself

506
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.590
in the infinite space.

507
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.670
That was a sphere with mass, not big.

508
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.490
But it didn't make me feel better.

509
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.840
The sphere was floating in the center of the space.

510
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.840
Nothing in the universe was exerting any forces on it,

511
00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.420
and there was nothing for it to exert forces on either.

512
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.480
It just floated in there.

513
00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.230
It would never move, or change in any way.

514
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.660
That's the most perfect interpretation of death.

515
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:48.500
Therefore, I created another sphere,

516
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.330
which was of the same mass and size as the first one's.

517
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:03.860
Their surfaces were total reflection mirrors.

518
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.650
They reflected each other,

519
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.960
reflected the only entity in the universe apart from themselves.

520
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.580
But the situation didn't improve much.

521
00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.840
Because if there was no initial movement,

522
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.840
the spheres would soon be drawn together by their gravity.

523
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:24.320
And then the two spheres would float there side by side, motionless.

524
00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.230
It'd still be a symbol of death.

525
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:33.480
But if there was initial movement and they didn't collide,

526
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.590
they would revolve around each other under their gravity.

527
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.030
No matter how you initialized them,

528
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:43.530
that kind of revolving would eventually stabilize and never change again.

529
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.120
The dance of death.

530
00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.180
So

531
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.760
I then introduced a third sphere,

532
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.230
and to my astonishment, the situation changed completely.

533
00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.130
Like I said, any geometric figure turns into numbers in the depths of my mind.

534
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.380
The sphereless, one-sphere, and two-sphere universes

535
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.960
all showed up as a single equation or a few equations that could describe it.

536
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.830
But this third sphere gave "emptiness" life.

537
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:15.550
The three spheres, given initial movements,

538
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.280
went through complex, seemingly never-repeating movements.

539
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.130
The descriptive equations rained down in a thunderstorm without end.

540
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.770
Just like that, I fell asleep.

541
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.590
The three spheres continued to dance in my dream,

542
00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.960
a patternless, never-repeating dance.

543
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.050
Yet, in the depths of my mind, the dance did possess a rhythm;

544
00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.320
it was just that its period of repetition was infinitely long.

545
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.640
This mesmerized me.

546
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.400
My attention had never been so completely engaged.

547
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.500
All the monks suspected I was crazy.

548
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.510
But Professor Han knew I had found emptiness.

549
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.340
My mindâ€¦

550
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.760
My mind was calm as never before.

551
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.400
It's such a big project.

552
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.250
For the first time, I enjoyed math.

553
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:35.930
Soâ€¦ So I want to describe the whole period or part of it.

554
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.770
So since then, you've been pursuing the Three-Body problem.
