2
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.800
Ji Chang, it's been eight nights.

3
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.280
We're in another Chaotic Era.

4
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.800
The sun hasn't risen again.

5
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.760
My king, this is temporary.

6
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.560
The sun will soon rise.

7
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.230
The Stable Era and the spring
will resume.

8
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.420
Heat the quadripod.

9
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.740
My king! My king! There areâ€¦

10
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.870
There are three flying stars in the sky!

11
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.570
You don't know what it means to have three flying stars in the sky, I presume?

12
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.560
It means a harsh winter is about to come.

13
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.210
It can freeze hard rocks into powder.

14
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.480
-Dehydrate! 
- Dehydrate.

15
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.640
- Dehydrate me.
- Dehydrate me.

16
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.480
Dehydrate me. 
- Dehydrate me!

17
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.230
Use slow fire.

18
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.910
Those who want to quit may quit now.

19
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.090
This game doesn't have anything to offer anymore.

20
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.650
You didn't quit the game either.

21
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.570
I think it's raining dry ice now.

22
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.190
These snowflakes are solid oxygen and nitrogen.

23
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.140
The atmosphere is gradually dissolving at absolute zero.

24
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.010
Then we'll soon lose oxygen.

25
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.360
<i>The long night lasted 48 years.</i>

26
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.470
<i>Civilization No. 137 was destroyed by the extreme cold.</i>

27
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.520
<i>This civilization had advanced to the Warring States Period.</i>

28
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.460
<i>The seed of civilization remains.</i>

29
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.440
<i>It will germinate and again progress through the unpredictable world of Three-Body.</i>

30
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.270
<i>We invite you to log in to the game again.</i>

31
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.080
Did you lose or win?

32
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.400
Did you lose or win?

33
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.170
It was awe-inspiring.

34
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.680
How did I die?

35
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680
Did I die of thirst?

36
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.530
You dehydrated.

37
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.100
All of the water in your body evaporated.

38
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.920
All your blood vessels shriveled.

39
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.790
You turned into a man-shaped skin.

40
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.130
Those jerks lied to me.

41
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.550
It was really so awe-inspiring.

42
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.920
A civilization was destroyed just like that.

43
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.270
Destroyed?

44
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.390
The farmer kicked the bucket?

45
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.160
What on earth is this game about?

46
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.800
King Wen of Zhou told me,

47
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.900
"This is a Chaotic Era."

48
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.060
The Stable Era seems to be an obsession of theirs.

49
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.460
Even now, I still haven't figured out what we should do exactly.

50
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.170
Should we look for patterns about the Stable Era?

51
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.930
Or should we find a way to continue the civilization in the Stable Eras and Chaotic Eras ?

52
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.600
Why is it so disorderly?

53
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.380
I don't know.

54
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.510
Maybe the game's not disorderly, but we just don't understand it yet.

55
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.020
How about we go back and try again while our morale's still high?

56
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.660
This time we swoop in and kill King Zhou of Shang together. Then this whole thing would be over, wouldn't it?

57
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.580
This game is not about killing people.

58
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.110
King Wen told me that the goal of this game is to figure out the pattern of the sun's movement.

59
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.510
The pattern of the sun's movement is that it rises in the east and sets in the west, isn't it?

60
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.060
In the world of Three-Body, the sun's movement does not follow that pattern.

61
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.260
When it's a Chaotic Era, in particular, the sun's movement is completely irregular.

62
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.580
It's a game. It does things as it pleases.

63
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.660
But have you noticed this?

64
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.290
In this game, many feelings are a bit too real.

65
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.710
Of course. I drank three bottles of water.

66
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.610
It strikes me that the purpose of making this game so realistic

67
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.780
is not to give players a better experience.

68
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.490
I specially checked the pyramid buried under the snow before quitting.

69
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.370
The bottom layer of the snow is solid water. The middle layer is dry ice.

70
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.820
The uppermost layer is solid oxygen and nitrogen.

71
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.490
Which company designed this game?

72
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.780
I don't know.

73
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.100
Practice makes perfect. Let's give it another few rounds, and get to the bottom of this matter.

74
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.720
Come in.

75
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.830
Mr. Wang.

76
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.060
Play another round. Play another round.

77
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.380
One more time. One more time. Come on. One more time.

78
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.940
Buddy, help me get my gloves. Thanks.

79
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.690
It's time for the meeting.

<i>[ Episode 8 ]</i>

88
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.570
Yo!

89
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.240
You hit my bike, but don't worry.

90
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.970
I'm not going to demand compensation.

91
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.380
You're practically a blackmail meister with an overactive imagination.

92
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.170
How could I cause such a severe car accident when I wasn't even in my car?

93
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.210
What do you want?

94
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.370
Look carefully.

95
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.340
Today I don't have a digital recorder on me.

96
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.720
It doesn't matter. I have nothing to say to you.

97
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.260
Not even about the Frontiers of Science?

98
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.380
There's nothing to say.

99
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.270
It seems you're still inept at dealing with reporters.

100
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.000
When asked by reporters, you should say "No comment", or "Never heard about it".

101
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.790
Saying that you have nothing to say means you know a lot, but are unwilling to disclose anything.

102
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.200
I don't want to say "No comment".

103
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.750
I do know a lot, but why should I tell you?

104
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.390
All right.

105
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.010
This proves my investigation's heading in the right direction.

106
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.030
I'm looking into the Frontiers of Science as well.

107
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.860
- Move your bike and get out of my sight.
- All right.

108
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.870
What a pity. You didn't disclose anything useful.

109
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.170
Hello?

110
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.840
I need you to keep looking into that Mu Xing girl for me.

111
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.910
We must find out what she's up to.

112
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.490
What happened exactly?

113
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.820
Why did you call me here in such a hurry at this late hour?

114
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.130
Are you Wang Miao?

115
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.200
I'm Professor Ye's student, Sha Ruishan.

116
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.030
Nice to meet you.

117
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.650
It's really an honor to meet you.

118
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.910
They are used for observation, but they have nothing to do with my project.

119
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.030
- Come. 
- Huh?

120
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.360
Come in with me.

121
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.490
Aren't they breathtaking? They are all like the ears of a deaf man.

122
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.920
Ever since construction was completed, interference has been unceasing in the observational bands.

123
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.960
First, there were the paging stations during the 80s.

124
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.200
Now, it's the mobile communication.

125
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.060
Most of the tasks that need metre-wave aperture synthesis
radio telescope can't be performed.

126
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.840
What on earth are you rambling on about?

127
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.210
Come on.

128
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.620
Solve it? Who will solve it?

129
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.170
Should mobile communication be stopped just because we want to explore the universe?

130
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.390
We don't have the money.

131
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.480
Right now, we can only use technical means to shield against interference.

132
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.770
My project only depends on satellite data.

133
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.720
The ground interference doesn't affect me much.

134
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.890
What do you want exactly?

135
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.760
We're running out of time. Let's go.

136
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.690
Let me show you around.

137
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.490
This is my lab.

138
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.570
It's like home to me. I usually live here.

139
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.640
Hurry. Hurry. Come on. Hurry.

140
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.110
Make yourself at home. Come on. Come in here.

141
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.580
- Have some water. 
- I don't want to drink it.

142
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.730
You must drink it. Take it.

143
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.020
My lab is used to receive the data sent by three satellites

144
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.610
and display them in real time on the eight terminals. Iâ€¦

145
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.600
Stand here.

146
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.550
Come here. Hurry.

147
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.330
Stand here.

148
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.800
Stop.

149
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
All right.

150
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.700
My job is to use these observational data to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background.

151
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.300
<i>What kind of data do you want to see?</i>

152
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.800
Can you be more specific?

153
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.300
Professor Wang, you're not a specialist in the field, right?

154
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.900
Do you have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?

155
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:32.100
The overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background is almost negligible.

156
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.600
Stop.

157
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.700
All right. Stay there.

158
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.100
Even with the sensitivity of the Planck satellite, continuous observation for a million years might not detect aâ€“

159
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.000
Stop.

160
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.900
You called me here at this late hour, had me wear the same clothes as the last time,

161
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:56.300
and then you said exactly what you said on that day.

162
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.000
What exactly is this about?

163
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.200
Stop.

164
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.000
Don't sit there.

165
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.300
Sit here.

166
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.200
Come on. Come on.

167
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.000
Hurry.

168
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.400
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

169
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:20.000
This morning, I ate a fried egg, and then went out on my bike.

170
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.300
I was two minutes late.

171
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.000
At noon, I knocked over a cup of coffee.

172
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.400
Before dinner, I hurt my foot when overhauling a piece of equipment.

173
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.400
And then in the evening, you came.

174
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.400
All these things were exactly the same as what happened on June 13th.

175
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.700
You and I saw the universe flicker.

176
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.000
It's almost time to make observations.

177
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.900
Come on. Sit straight.

178
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.200
The universe is not going to flicker tonight.

179
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.800
It's almost time.

180
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.000
Three, two, one.

181
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.600
Like I said, the universe is not going to flicker tonight.

182
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.200
Did you wear black socks on that day as well?

183
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.900
Do you think the universe will flicker again if we repeat all this?

184
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.800
Are you implying we're controlling cosmic flicker?

185
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.300
Is it you or me who has that ability?

186
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.400
Do you really believe the universe can flicker?

187
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.100
Hold on a second.

188
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.550
The whole universe flickered on such a massive scale.

189
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.750
I didn't believe that.

190
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.790
If you tell me someone placed a gigantic screen in the universe

191
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.000
to make us think the universe flickered, I wouldn't believe that either.

192
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.100
Both cosmic flicker and gigantic screens are things we can neither believe nor comprehend,

193
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.400
but it did happen right in front of our eyes.

194
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.700
We are the chosen ones.

195
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.200
Chosen?

196
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.100
By who?

197
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.600
A lot of people got hit by apples.

198
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:35.200
Orchardists, children, sheep herders, horse wranglers, but only Newton was the chosen one 
<i>(T/N: Newton's name literally means "cow herder")</i>

199
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:46.000
Since my childhood, I felt that someday I'd become an astronomer.

200
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.200
I believe all these things are guidance from a deity.

201
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.200
So a deity led you into scientific research?

202
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.900
Professor Wang. Do you believe God parted the Red Sea for Moses?

203
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.800
I'm a scientist.

204
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:18.700
I mustn't believe that, but how is what we saw that day any different from God parting the Red Sea?

205
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.100
I want to research all this.

206
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.000
I want to understand all this.

207
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.500
I want to know the truth.

208
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.300
Professor Wang, don't you want to know the truth?

209
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.800
I don't.

210
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.590
Comrades, this is a war.

211
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.000
Although we still don't know who our enemies are,

212
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.600
or what they look like, or how they exist, we do know one thing.

213
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:21.100
Those dead scientists were important assets to the world, and even to mankind.

214
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:27.500
If a war breaks out, or post-war reconstruction becomes necessary, they'll play an important part.

215
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.300
We need them.

216
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.700
Almost all the suicides were connected to the Frontiers of Science.

217
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.800
Why don't we just attack them?

218
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.300
The Frontiers of Science is still an international academic group.

219
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.000
We have no reason to attack them.

220
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.800
Besides, they're scholars.

221
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.800
Any move against them will cause severe social influences.

222
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.500
Do you have any suggestions, General Chang?

223
00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:02.200
I suggest we keep top scientists of all Combat Zones under surveillance.

224
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:08.000
If we detect any signs of the Frontiers of Science contacting or swaying them,

225
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.200
we'll immediately adopt protection measures.

226
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.800
Morning.

227
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.400
Wang Miao, come here.

228
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.600
Your timing's perfect.

229
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.400
My ten assistants wrote this report on Three-Body.

230
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.300
Yesterday they played it all night.

231
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.600
All right.

232
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600
You had ten assistants play a video game?

233
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
Justâ€¦ Just read it.

234
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.300
Okay.

235
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.300
[Asian Defense Council]
[Three-Body game report]

236
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.600
This report is pretty long.

237
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.400
And it seems pretty meticulous.

238
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.700
I had several gaming sessions, collecting one type of game information at a time.

239
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.800
Information about the environment, the creatures, and how players feel.

240
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.700
Then I sorted and summarized it.

241
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.100
My assistant, Xu Bingbing.

242
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.900
Well, when playing it, did the ten of you figure out the pattern of the sun's movement?

243
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.000
Yeah.

244
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
But so far we haven't been able to draw any conclusions.

245
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.200
The shift between the Chaotic Era and the Stable Era is random.

246
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.400
It switches between extreme cold and scorching heat without any warning.

247
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.400
Sometimes it even happens repeatedly in an hour.

248
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.600
When it's a Chaotic Era, apart from dehydration, are there any other ways of survival?

249
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.900
I did some observing.

250
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.000
Some mire fish can survive extremely hot weather.

251
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
If humans dig a hideout before the mire dries up as those fish do,

252
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.600
and the Chaotic Era is short enough, maybe they'll survive.

253
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.000
Are the "mire fish" you talk about similar to the African lungfish?

254
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.100
Herring? 
<i>(T/N: There is a small tone difference between lungfish and herring in Chinese)</i>

255
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.000
The kind they make stinky canned fish with?

256
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.300
- Lungfish.
- It's lungfish.

257
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.200
Africans once found that some fish would burrow into the mud

258
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.500
for shelter during the dry season, leaving only some small air vents.

259
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.400
Lungfish can stay alive in dormancy for almost four years.

260
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.400
So the ten of you wrote this report together?

261
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.200
Didn't I introduce my ten assistants to you on your arrival?

262
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.600
Xu Bingbing.

263
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.800
She's worth ten assistants. Very knowledgeable.

264
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.200
Almost as capable as me.

265
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.300
You, uhâ€¦

266
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.300
Don't mop the floor again.

267
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.900
Let's continue.

268
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:20.800
But humans are unable to lie dormant as lungfish do, so this information is useless.

269
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.900
Professor Wang. Does it strike you that this game is alarmingly meticulous in terms of details?

270
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.400
Yeah.

271
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.200
There are mire fish in the mire.

272
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.200
What falls from the sky is dry ice instead of snow.

273
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.400
Though it's just a video game, it's unduly realistic.

274
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.300
I told him the other day that these massive details were far beyond the concept of a gaming experience.

275
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.400
Then what are they?

276
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.000
Iâ€¦ I'll figure out how to explain this to you.

277
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.200
Surely you know the picture Along the River During the Qingming Festival.
<i>(T/N: Very detailed painting of a wedding procession on a bridge)</i>

278
00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200
I do.

279
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.000
- The one with hundreds of people in it?
- Yeah.

280
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.700
Which one contains more information?

281
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.500
Along the River During the Qingming Festival or this one?

282
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.800
This pictureâ€¦ It contains information?

283
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:28.300
It does, and its information is tens, even thousands of times that of Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

284
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:36.500
Normally, the details of a video game are designed to give the players better experience,

285
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.100
so game designers will capture more character movements and render more images

286
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.600
to increase the amount of information as much as they can so as to make the game more realistic.

287
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.600
Just like Along the River During the Qingming Festival.

288
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.600
But the designer of this game did the exact opposite.

289
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.600
There's a huge amount of information hidden behind this game.

290
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.700
Just like this picture.

291
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.000
It attempts to drastically compress the information, as if trying to hide some kind of enormous truth.

292
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.700
Since the designer has so many ideas, who don't we just seek him out and get the answers from him?

293
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.300
I looked into it, but I couldn't find any information about the designer of Three-Body.

294
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:21.000
Well, did you look into who might be capable of designing a video game like this?

295
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:25.750
I don't think any individuals can develop a game like this.

296
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:31.090
Only very established and strong video game companies or top-notch game designer groups can do it.

297
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.100
The login interface of the domestic version of this game is in Chinese,

298
00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.200
so I sifted out all the outstanding video game companies.

299
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.600
I think these ones might be capable enough to do this.

300
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.200
We could consult with them. 
<i></i>[Game Design Companies]

301

All right.

302
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.200
A quick off-topic question.

303
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.600
What's the monthly salary of the "ten of you"?

304
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.600
Not much.

305
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.800
I get only the normal salary.

306
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.500
How can they do this?

307
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.800
How can they give you only the normal salary?

308
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.300
From now on, mopping the floor will be my job.

309
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.600
Actually, this game has been there for quite some time.

310
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.800
We just never paid any attention to it.

311
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.000
Our investigation shows most of the players of this game

312
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
are scientists, or elite intellectuals.

313
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.400
Many of them are members of the Frontiers of Science.

314
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.200
Yang Dong never played this game, right?

315
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.200
And neither did Munphy, right?

316
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.400
We looked into those dead scientists.

317
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.700
None of them even owned a VR device.

318
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.800
Why did they pick Wang Miao to play this game?

319
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.700
Maybe it's an interview.

320
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:55.100
Wang Miao agreed to join them, and he needed to clear this game to gain their recognition.

321
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.100
Xu Bingbing, youâ€¦

322
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.000
"The ten of you" should clear this game as soon as possible.

323
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.600
If I clear it, it won't do any good.

324
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.200
This test is for Wang Miao.

325
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.400
Why won't it do any good?

326
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.400
If you clear it, you'll know the key to the clearance, which will be helpful to Wang Miao.

327
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:13.000
You're doing much better than I did when I first played the game.

328
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.200
What's the pattern of the sun's movement in the world of Three-Body?

329
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.800
You play it every day?

330
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:31.400
You told me I needed to see the farmer's world with my own eyes, but where on earth is the farmer?

331
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.200
The gathering is about to begin.

332
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.700
Why don't you come and review it?

333
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.400
Is it still about the shooter and the farmer?

334
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.100
I've heard that twice.

335
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.200
Hearing it one more time will help you know more about Lord.

336
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.200
How did it go?

337
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.800
Do you know any of today's attendees?

338
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.700
I've met some of them before.

339
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.600
Which ones?

340
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.300
Which ones have frequent dealings with Shen Yufei? Tell me.

341
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.400
Don't "Ah" me.

342
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.600
Think back.

343
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.900
I didn't recognize all of them.

344
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.600
Just tell me the ones you recognized. Think about it carefully.

345
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.200
I just know one of them was Pan Jianzhong.

346
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.400
He specializes in quantum optics.

347
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.100
There have been many reports about him lately.

348
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.200
Give the others some thought, okay?

349
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.000
Try to remember.

350
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.800
Think about it carefully.

351
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.800
Mr. Pan.

352
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.600
Mr. Pan, I'm sorry.

353
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.400
Looks like I'm late anyway.

354
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.700
What would you like to drink? My treat.

355
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:29.200
Shi. Recently, another couple of foreign scientists died.

356
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.600
Also suicide?

357
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.200
The Combat Zones created a new plan.

358
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.600
How many have you recalled?

359
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.000
Captain Shi, Professor Wang, this is the roster.

360
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.400
Wh-what?

361
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.600
Roster.

362
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600
I, uh, have a list of names.

363
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.000
It can be said the names of all top-notch scientists of all fields are on the list.

364
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.800
We need to keep them under surveillance?

365
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.200
Under protection.

366
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.000
Read it carefully and see if any of them attended today's gathering, or has close ties with Shen Yufei.

367
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.400
There are too many of them, so I can't protect every single one of them.

368
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.200
Then we protect those in contact with the Frontiers of Science.

369
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.000
Brother, you recalled only three during the ride?
[Pan Jianzhong, Sun Bogang, Zhang Feiyang.]

370
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.400
Well, I can remember nanotech devices, but I'm really not good with names.

371
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.500
Besides, why do you want me to think about this?

372
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:18.900
Many attend the gatherings of the Frontiers of Science, but only a few of them are truly interested.

373
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.000
I have an audacious assumption.

374
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.400
Those having dealings with the Frontiers of Science have two possible endings.

375
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.000
One is that they pretend to trust them, cooperate with them and join them as you do.

376
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.500
The other is that they commit suicide because they can't stand it.

377
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.300
Right now we need to seek out all the scientists who might kill themselves,

378
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.800
- so we can protect them. Understand?
- Understood.

379
00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.600
Seek them out!

380
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.800
Mr. Pan, I've read all the info sheets.

381
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.700
I find them very thought-provoking.

382
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.100
You mentioned a set of data in your info sheets. 
 <i>[Impact of Environmental Pollution on Ecology]</i>

383
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:50.200
In the last 40 years, due to human activities, the number of sparrows in Country T has decreased by 57%.

384
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.500
The number of aquatic birds in Albax is 81% smaller than the previous year,

385
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.500
and that of Asian white-backed vultures decreased by 99.9%.

386
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.200
They've almost become extinct.

387
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.500
Our earth is faced with such a dire environmental situation, but we're turning a blind eye to it.

388
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.800
Unless their own lives are in danger, most people will choose to ignore it.

389
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.000
Yeah.

390
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.200
They don't care about the ozone hole, or water pollution, or air pollution.

391
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.200
You're ignoring one thing.

392
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.000
Yeah. Light pollution.

393
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.500
You mentioned it in the info sheets.

394
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.300
I find that thought-provoking as well.

395
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.300
Bright light at night makes it difficult for flying insects to orient themselves,

396
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.300
and the flowers that rely on nocturnal insects to spread their pollen will have difficulty multiplying.

397
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.800
They'll gradually disappear from the earth.

398
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.700
In the long run, it'll damage the earth's ecosystem.

399
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.700
<i>[Pan Jianzhong]</i>

400
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.500
No. I really can't remember so many names. I'm about to pass out.

401
00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.800
Keep it up.

402
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.000
You can do this.

403
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I can only recall that earlier today, there was this guy who's a bit older than others.

404
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.800
His hair's a bit grizzled.

405
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.400
He has a small beard on his chin which is also grizzled.

406
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.600
He talked about something about northern construction.

407
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.400
I found him. A fluid dynamics expert. Cheng Yuan.

408
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.300
Come on.

409
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.500
Keep it up. This is the sixth one.

410
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.800
I remember one more guy.

411
00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.000
He had this dimple on the right side of his face when he smiled.

412
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
I think he specializes in quantum dynamics.

413
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.200
Is there a guy like that?

414
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.200
What's his name? Do some digging.

415
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.700
Zhai Yiming. He works at Central China University.

416
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.600
Awesome!

417
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.600
Keep it up, Wang Miao. This is the seventh one. Go for it!

418
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.800
There's another one.

419
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.600
He works in the Atmospheric Physics Research Center.

420
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.900
He's well-featured and a bit square-faced, but I know he has asthma because he keeps using a spray.

421
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.800
Zhang Jiuchao.

422
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.000
Attaboy! You're the man! You can do this. Go for it!

423
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.500
I can do it! I can do it!

424
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.600
Mr. Pan, I think if I put all these in a newspaper,

425
00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.200
the public is bound to be very shocked by them.

426
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.600
Shocked?

427
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.000
Will shocking them do any good?

428
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.400
Will anybody care?

429
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.100
Take you for example.

430
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.700
When you gunned your bike to make it to this interview in time,

431
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.400
did you think of what the exhaust gas might do to the environment?

432
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.100
Will you feel guilty when turning on the headlight of your bike on the road at night?

433
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.800
In the interests of hygiene, you had the waiter put your coffee into a takeout cup.

434
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.000
Did you think of the damage it might cause?

435
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.300
You've read all the info sheets, but what influence did they have on you?

436
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.500
Did you change in any way?

437
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.100
What's the point of putting them in an article?

438
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:43.900
Mr. Pan, your words are even more thought-provoking than the info sheets.

439
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.400
Well, what can I do?

440
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.200
Your efforts to publicize these are commendable enough.

441
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.000
If everyone is environmentally aware enough to ask what they can do, we'll have a chance.

442
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.800
Do you know the correct way to dispose of batteries?

443
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.000
<i>[List of scientists in need of protection]</i>

444
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.700
With this list, we've kept nine scientists who have close ties with Shen Yufei under constant surveillance.

445
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.400
Most of them specialize in branches of physics.

446
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.700
What have physicists done to deserve this?

447
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.300
If anything abnormal is detected, we'll put them under protection immediately.

448
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.800
Liar!

449
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.000
You liar, Newton!

450
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.600
Schrodinger, you liar!

451
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.600
Einstein, you liar.

452
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.000
<i>[ City Journal ] 
[ Research Receives International Recognition ]</i>

453
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Cavendish, you liar.

454
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.400
Dirac, you liar.

455
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.700
You liars.

456
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.750
Fortunately, it's Sunday, so there's nobody working in the lab.

457
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.030
The one who found the body was the security guard on duty this weekend.

458
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:02.400
We've handled it, minimizing the aftermath of this incident.

459
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.000
Did he have dealings with anybody?

460
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.400
No. It's still suicide, without doubt.

461
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.100
Only days ago, his research received international recognition.

462
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.600
He was scheduled to give several interviews in the next few days,

463
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.600
and his department was going to hold a meeting to commend him next week.

464
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.600
He even prepared an acceptance speech.

465
00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.800
Then he killed himself?

466
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800
Yeah, he did.

467
00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.100
Mandatory protection.

468
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.800
I'm very sorry to have brought you here

469
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.600
in this fashion, but you have nothing to worry about.

470
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.600
We're protecting you.

471
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.400
Lately, a lot of scientists committed suicide without warning.

472
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.600
We suspect that there's more to those suicides.

473
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.700
I don't want anything like that to happen to you.

474
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.300
You're all elites of our country.

475
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:25.600
It can be said that you've made great contributions to our nation, our country, even mankind.

476
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:32.400
I really hope you can leave aside the scientific research you're doing and stay under our protection.

477
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:39.800
We'll ascertain the truth asap lest your lives be threatened again.

478
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.500
As for your original departments and families,
 [Transfer Letter from Battle Command Center]

479
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.200
you may rest assured that we'll make proper arrangements.

480
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.700
All of us will claim that you were transferred temporarily for a scientific research project.

481
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.100
Please trust me.

482
00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.000
Everything I did is to ensure your safety.

483
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.510
Do you know that these places were covered in greenery only years ago?

484
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.230
But now they're a scene of utter desolation.

485
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:20.130
Actually, what we need to know is much more than these things.

486
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.610
On earth, dozens of species go extinct every day.

487
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:29.130
And the carbon dioxide levels in the air are the highest in three million years.

488
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:33.150
Even in the untraversed Antarctica, plastic trash has been found.

489
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:36.590
Maybe you feel that none of this has anything to do with you.

490
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.840
To save time, you press your foot down sharply on the gas pedal

491
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.150
without realizing how much damage the exhaust gas might cause.

492
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.760
That Mu Xing girl you told me to look into recorded a program in the studio.

493
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.280
Still about environmental protection.

494
00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.700
You buy a bubble tea at the roadside and use a takeout container without a second thought.

495
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.070
If the contents of her recording is problematic, don't let her release it.

496
00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.760
Yes.

497
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.110
Where will plastic litter end up?

498
00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.030
Someone visited her during the filming.

499
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.000
They had a talk, and then she left without finishing the filming.

500
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.360
Where did she go?

501
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.700
Don't worry. I had someone tail her.

502
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.760
<i>[Mu Xing]</i>

503
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.040
So you're Mu Xing?

504
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.510
Nobody attacked him.

505
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.480
All his vitals are normal.

506
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.590
He just has blurred vision.

507
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.590
Blurred vision?

508
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.400
Yeah.

509
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.880
He says his field of view is filled with sparks.

510
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.880
Sparks and electrical sparks.

511
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.190
He can hardly see anything else.

512
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.280
Send him to a hospital.

513
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.550
Make sure he's properly protected.

514
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.030
Yes.

515
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.030
That man was carried onto an ambulance.

516
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.550
He's a scientist specializing in quantum electrodynamics,

517
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.380
Zhai Yiming.

518
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.760
How's the definition of the footage?

519
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.670
Impressive.

520
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.560
You found out as well?

521
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.070
Found out what?

522
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.800
These scientists are under house arrest.

523
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.550
Apart from him, there are others.

524
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:41.990
I strongly suspect that this has something to do with the suicides of those scientists.

525
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.440
This is a protection measure.

526
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.130
It was your doing?

527
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.800
- Come with me.
- Please don't.

528
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.500
Now!

529
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.030
Speak!

530
00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.310
According to the regulations, I can stay here for 24 hours, right?

531
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.120
24 hours.

532
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.110
I doubt you can sit here for 24 hours without telling me anything.

533
00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.730
Those are my lines.

534
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.420
I should say the same thing to you.

535
00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.590
How did you know Zhai Yiming was there?

536
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.850
<i>Who told you?</i>

537
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.280
<i>Who's the guy visiting you in your studio this afternoon?</i>

538
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.140
Do you think it's possible that he told me the address because he's also worried about the scientists' safety?

539
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.710
If he was worried, he would've told the police.

540
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.670
He told you because he wanted you to cause panic.

541
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.410
I'm spreading the truth.

542
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.600
That's bullshit!

543
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.280
What you should do the most is to keep your nose clean and don't cause us trouble.

544
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.590
What's the point of burying your head in the sand like an ostrich?

545
00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:00.040
Everybody deserves to know the truth.

546
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.840
You think I was the only one who found out about the scientists' whereabouts?

547
00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.500
You can stop me, but can you stop everybody else from spreading the truth?

548
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.910
Officer Shi. Please be cooperative.

549
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.070
You have the information I want, and I have the information you want.

550
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:19.130
Why don't we just trust each other and be honest with each other?

551
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:23.360
You think this is a cafÃ© or something?

552
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.510
Do you know what this place is?

553
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.180
I do.

554
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.340
Then why are you bargaining with me?

555
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.070
You think you're in a position to bargain with me?

556
00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.900
Captain Shi, why don't you let me ask her?

557
00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.570
Do you thinkâ€¦

558
00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.590
Describe what you saw.

559
00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.330
I can't.

560
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.880
I couldn't see anything else.

561
00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.050
One second, there were sparks. Then next, there were electrical sparks.

562
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:12.830
Anyway, it's like there were fireworks crackling in front of my eyes.

563
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:14.710
The glare almost blinded me.

564
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.280
Fireworks crackling?

565
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.220
No firecrackers?

566
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.400
No.

567
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.110
Then why did you hear the crackle?

568
00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.070
There was no crackle.

569
00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.920
Just a glare.

570
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.550
What about now?

571
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.440
It suddenlyâ€¦ suddenly stopped.

572
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.960
Are you sure there were only fireworks?

573
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.510
I'm sure.

574
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:35.560
No numbers?

575
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.190
Even if there were, I wouldn't have been able to see them.

576
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.710
There were sparks everywhere.

577
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.360
What did the doctor say?

578
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.480
Severe floater.

579
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.550
How's he now?

580
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.290
He's recovered.

581
