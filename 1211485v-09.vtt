00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.580
<i>The planned route of the torch relay for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games</i>

2
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.350
<i> - was officially released in April. 
 - That's right. </i>

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.720
<i>Currently, preparations for the torch relay are in full swing. </i>

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.600
<i>As far as we know, the torch relay of the Beijing Olympic Games</i>

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.270
<i>will manifest the concept of green Olympics.</i>

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.940
<i>Environmental awareness will run throughout the whole relay.</i>

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.350
<i>The Beijing Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games</i>

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.110
<i>have formulated environmental standards of conduct for all people,</i>

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.580
<i>note that it's all people participating in the Olympic torch relay,</i>

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.440
<i> - including torch bearers. 
 - Exactly. </i>

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.540
<i>It seems that our environmental awareness...</i>

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.830
<i>Yes. We've learned from the environmental promotion</i>

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.060
<i>that the BOCOG requires all people participating in the torch relay</i>

14
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.790
<i>not to use disposable foam tableware, or wooden chopsticks.</i>

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.900
<i>They also suggest that we should actively reduce the use of disposable towels, etc.</i>

16
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.310
<i>They particularly encourage people to take buses, 
 - That's right.</i>

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.730
<i>to reduce energy consumption and vehicle emissions.</i>

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.280
<i>Exactly.</i>

19
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.570
- I'm home. 
 - Finally.

20
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.740
Your daughter has been waiting for you all night.

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.300
Doudou, Dad is home.

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.780
Your rescuer has come.

23
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.250
What's up?

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.350
After you gave the speech at her school, she became interested in physics.

25
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.610
Look, she's doing an experiment.

26
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.920
Doudou, what experiment needs so many eggs?

27
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.210
The teacher asked us to put the egg into the bottle intact.

28
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.840
For the experiment, Doudou has already eaten several eggs tonight.

29
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.200
Are you upset?

30
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.970
The bottle is small and the egg is big.

31
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.060
It can't be pushed in.

32
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.020
Dad will figure out a way.

33
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.620
Let's see if I can help you, okay?

34
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.700
Here, hold the egg.

35
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.500
Doudou, hold the egg.

36
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.930
When I tell you to release it, put it at the mouth of the bottle,

37
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.000
okay?

38
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.940
Get ready.

39
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.360
Three, two, one.

40
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.080
Release.

41
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.120
Mom, Mom, come here!

42
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.100
Coming.

43
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.180
Look. The egg went in on its own.

44
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.680
Wow. It really did.

45
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.360
Amazing!

46
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.210
Dad, can you tell me why?

47
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.740
Let me tell you.

48
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.910
There are many tiny molecules both in the bottle and outside of it.

49
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.160
The fire Dad lit burned some of the molecules out.

50
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.740
So there was more space inside, and the tiny molecules outside were impatient to get in.

51
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.480
So they pushed the egg in.

52
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.720
Physics is amazing, just like magic.

53
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.660
Physics isn't magic.

63
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.780
It only took you three hours?

64
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.600
How did you make it?

65
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.700
The first two hours and 55 minutes, I sat in front of her without saying a word.

66
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.560
She couldn't stand it anymore.

67
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.460
I couldn't have stood it either if it were me. And then?

68
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.040
Then I told her that it was a state-level secret and I wanted her to cooperate.

69
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.110
That's all?

70
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.920
I promised her that she could continue the investigation without disclosing the secret.

71
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.900
Let her make more trouble?

72
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.070
She really did find something.

73
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.920
This is the video Mu Xing got.

74
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.680
All eight safe houses have all been exposed.

75
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.180
It's weird.

76
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.810
The SWAT teams escorting the scientists

77
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.230
didn't even know the locations of the safe houses until the last minute before arriving.

78
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.370
Then the secret couldn't have been let out.

79
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.460
Many impossible things have happened recently.

80
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.790
Look.

81
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.330
From the beginning of the shoot to the time when the scientists entered the safe houses,

82
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.600
before the SWAT teams knew where the houses were located,

83
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.820
they had already made all the preparations for the shoot.

84
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.430
There must be a snitch then.

85
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.020
If there's really a snitch, it could only be one person, me.

86
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.830
Don't say that about yourself.

87
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.500
That's not right.

88
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:14.450
I chose the eight safe houses from my file and numbered them one by one.

89
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.990
I didn't inform any team members until the last moment.

90
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.360
How could the secret have been leaked?

91
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.160
Physics doesn't exist.

92
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.640
Have you found the source of Mu Xing's information?

93
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.440
<i> Since the Olympic Games were open to booking, </i>

94
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.220
<i> tickets for the opening ceremony have been a hit in public bookings. </i>

95
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.100
<i> Judging by the current orders, </i>

96
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.590
<i> most people have booked tickets for the opening ceremony. </i>

97
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.540
<i> The orders are far more than the 26,000 tickets provided by the BOCOG. </i>

98
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.380
Brat.

99
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.580
Why are you standing here?

100
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.640
Waiting for you.

101
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.840
Waiting for me?

102
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.880
If I wanted to escape, how could your beat up car catch up with me?

103
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.070
Really? What car do you drive?

104
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.820
The same brand as yours, but different class.

105
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.850
What's the output volume?

106
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.480
Four-wheel drive?

107
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.070
Why are you waiting for me here?

108
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:10.330
It's convenient.

109
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.230
After you finish interrogating me, I can pick up my car by myself, right?

110
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.500
Come on.

111
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.200
- Let's go in my beat up car. 
 - Let's go.

112
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.820
- Come on. 
 - I can do it myself.

113
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.310
- Can you? 
 - Yes, no problem.

114
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.700
<i>We're in an extremely precarious situation here.</i>

115
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.160
<i>If we take them into protective custody, they'll accuse us of strong arming them.</i>

116
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.010
<i>There will be public unrest, riots, and god knows what else.</i>

117
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.030
<i>On the other hand, we have to act now.</i>

118
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.610
General Chang, your sector is the only one under control, am I right?

119
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:54.170
It's only temporary. I don't know if tomorrow we'll be facing the same situation as you are.

120
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.720
Each and every move of ours is exposed to the enemy.

121
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.320
And we don't ever know who are they by now.

122
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.440
Are you scared?

123
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.120
Frankly speaking, I'm scared.

124
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.100
I would rather face a real war,

125
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.910
than be how we are now, like a turkey waiting for Thanksgiving.

126
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.200
Old Shi, rumors are a fearful thing.

127
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.320
Right now, the Combat Zones are under the pressure of public opinion.

128
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.900
Fortunately, we've controlled the malicious spread of information.

129
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.920
I've already caught the messenger. I'll interrogate him later.

130
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.820
Did you catch him? You really know how to boast.

131
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.650
He drove here himself.

132
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.470
Whatever, he is the first one we've caught.

133
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.030
Okay.

134
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.710
You rock!

135
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.500
You've been here for more than a year, right?

136
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:53.550
If you hadn't occupied the museum, it would have opened a long time ago.

137
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.470
In that case, I should be the first tourist, right?

138
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.600
Tourists can leave after the visit.

139
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.250
That's why I parked my car at the door. It'll be more convenient for me to drive off.

140
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.120
This place should be the Asian Combat Zone.

141
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.290
The European Combat Zone was established earlier.

142
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.130
Of course, the earliest established

143
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:29.790
should be in Lington, Country M's North American Combat Zone.

144
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:36.240
Now, Oceania, South America and Africa should have taken it seriously too.

145
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.080
Combat Zone, seriously?

146
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.990
Do you know who you're fighting against?

147
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.150
Amazing, simply amazing!

148
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.150
I only read your paper recently.

149
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.380
I never thought that at that time, you had already correctly predicted

150
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.560
that long-term consumption of genetically modified foods would cause controversy.

151
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:08.320
You also predicted the ecological disasters that would come with genetically modified crops.

152
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.120
The specific details were close to life and horrifying.

153
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.270
Do you know how those scholars assessed you?

154
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.810
From the future.

155
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.200
God's eye.

156
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.920
According to your theory, should I discard the straw and the can separately?

157
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.840
It makes no difference.

158
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.630
When they're shipped to the dump, they'll still be mixed together.

159
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.010
I'm relieved to hear that.

160
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.720
Hu Xiaoxi, graduated from the Electronic Engineering and Information Institute,

161
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.030
works in Songjie Network Service as a service administrator.

162
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.960
So you're an administrator of an Internet cafe.

163
00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:01.790
Six years ago, you started to write science fiction online under the pseudonym, Poet of Chuantuo.

164
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:06.260
Your fiction attracts almost no readers.

165
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.120
Last year, you participated in a cyber-fiction competition.

166
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.680
- The prize was about $740,000. 
- Yes.

167
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.500
It was said that whoever wrote a more terrifying future would be more likely to win the prize.

168
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.380
You somehow, mysteriously won the prize, didn't you?

169
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.260
General Chang, I think you should be more curious about

170
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:37.960
how I know about your combat zone and the locations of your safe houses.

171
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.250
Alright. Come on. Tell me then.

172
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.790
Who are you all?

173
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:49.200
General Chang, you are responsible for the protection of the scientists.

174
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.060
Only at the last moment, would you tell your men about the locations. 
<i>[List of scientists in need of protection]</i>

175
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.390
Before that, nobody knew anything other than you.

176
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.200
Don't you find that strange at all?

177
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:07.050
How could I arrive at the safe houses before your order was even given?

178
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.640
That's right. Isn't that what you came to talk to me about today?

179
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.390
I can really understand what you're feeling.

180
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.620
After all, you're leading a combat zone. You have to know the enemy you're going to face.

181
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.980
Okay. Let me tell you.

182
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.400
Your enemy at the moment is me.

183
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.010
You look a little dismissive. You may think I'm not qualified.

184
00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.880
Fine. Then let me ask you, what are your combat zones doing?

185
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.960
You're investigating the suicides of scientists.

186
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.670
Of course, you call those accidental deaths.

187
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.030
Then today, let me make it clear for you.

188
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.600
Their suicides were just that, suicides.

189
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.750
<i>I didn't tell anyone where the safe houses were.</i>

190
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:05.740
<i>I've thought it over. It might have been leaked when I pulled the information.</i>

191
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:11.440
But, you're definitely not the boss behind the scenes.

192
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.150
You received an email that informed you of the locations.

193
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.670
On that day, you answered a phone call that lasted 11 seconds.

194
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:26.100
You were told to record the video. But you were short of hands, so you sought some help from friends.

195
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.480
After you took the video, you gave it to her.

196
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.570
- What's her name? 
- Mu Xing.

197
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.280
That's right. You gave it to her.

198
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.870
I've got two pieces of information, the phone call and the e-mail.

199
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.870
But I don't know who gave you the call and sent you the e-mail.

200
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.850
So I'll ask you again, who are you all exactly?

201
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.200
General Chang, why do you still not understand?

202
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.000
That's not the question you should ask.

203
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.980
You should ask about us. Who are we?

204
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.150
Okay. I tell you what, let me tell you a story.

205
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.680
Once upon a time, there was a farm.

206
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.480
Stop. Stop. Stop.

207
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:27.420
You're going to tell me that I'm a two-dimensional creature, or a turkey, aren't you?

208
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.880
Then tell me, who is this farmer exactly?

209
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.350
Nothing left to say?

210
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:42.980
Fine. Even if there is such a farmer, he would never hire such a dumb turkey like you to work for them.

211
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.400
All right. I don't think you can tell me anything useful today.

212
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.830
Go home.

213
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.350
No, I...

214
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.750
No, wait, wait, wait.

215
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.920
Y-You should continue the interrogation. Did you even interrogate me?

216
00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.440
Does it make any sense to?

217
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.000
It's only a waste of my words.

218
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.810
- Go on. 
<i>- No. I...</i>

219
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.790
By the way, you said you wanted to be my enemy.

220
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.720
You're not qualified.

221
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.540
You're really a piece of work.

222
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.680
You caught a dumb ass. How could you waste my time like that?

223
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.110
Did I catch him? He drove here himself.

224
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.710
Old Chang, I have to warn you that each of your eight houses have been exposed.

225
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.440
We got the list from Wang Miao.

226
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.160
This means Wang Miao's cover must have been blown in the Frontiers of Science.

227
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.500
When I got that list, I was already mentally prepared to be exposed.

228
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.740
What should we do then?

229
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.880
Proceed as usual.

230
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:19.380
If it weren't for me, you would have lost contact with those eight people.

231
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.200
So what?

232
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.200
The Battle Command Center only locked them up to suspend their research.

233
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.650
They didn't lock them up.

234
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:32.880
They're protecting them.

235
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.780
This list was leaked by your member, Wang Miao.

236
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.640
The activities of our group have always been above board.

237
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.200
It can't be regarded as a leak to tell an outright thing.

238
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.030
But Wang Miao isn't outright enough with you.

239
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.790
And he still... hasn't stopped his research.

240
00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.360
When Wang Miao first played the game,

241
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.920
he performed better than you and I did.

242
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.640
It means that he can understand the Lord faster than we did.

243
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.510
It means nothing.

244
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.830
He isn't our comrade.

245
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.130
None of us can alter the will of the Lord.

246
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.310
Did your Hu Xiaoxi, follow the will of the Lord?

247
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.590
Did the Lord let him swagger into the Battle Command Center to show off and demonstrate?

248
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.690
I've never liked him driving, let alone driving cars with large-engines.

249
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.590
It isn't environmentally friendly.

250
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.750
Lord will never see him again.

251
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.720
Press!

252
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.690
Harder!

253
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.590
All right! All right!

254
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:14.980
Wash your hands.

255
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.820
What's wrong?

256
00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:23.150
Inadequate stress on the two contact faces caused a large amount of loss during the power transmission.

257
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.480
Don't you scientists love to talk like that?

258
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.050
What? You don't understand?

259
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.070
The belt is loose.

260
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.620
Okay.

261
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.800
You caught all the people on the list I gave you, didn't you?

262
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.210
We didn't catch them, instead, we tried to protect them.

263
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.880
But you still failed.

264
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.540
I can feel that Old Chang is under great pressure even though he doesn't tell me.

265
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.880
Just think.

266
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.490
He made the plan himself and didn't tell anyone, yet it was leaked.

267
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:11.140
Clearly, the Center must be under close surveillance.

268
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.730
We should take the initiative.

269
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.520
Shen Yufei must have seen through me now.

270
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.850
And you still want me to contact her.

271
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.730
Don't you think she'll keep an eye on me?

272
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.160
I've discussed it with Old Chang.

273
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.610
It doesn't matter whether you leak the secret or not.

274
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.190
After all, their gatherings are above board.

275
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.020
She must have other plans for you.

276
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.370
But for your safety, I should go with you to see Shen Yufei and talk to her.

277
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.740
We'd better cut to the chase.

278
00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.390
If there really is any danger, I'll tell you to leave immediately.

279
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.910
I told you that I would protect you.

280
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.210
I must protect Copernicus.

281
00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.860
<i>[ Waste water from Xitang Village ]</i>

282
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.740
Mr. Pan.

283
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.720
You're on time.

284
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.120
I walked here today.

285
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.310
This, I replaced its battery with a rechargeable one.

286
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.030
Thanks a lot.

287
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.320
It's what I should do.

288
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.310
Actually, that's what everyone should do.

289
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:45.300
Unfortunately, people only pay attention to things concerning their own interests, or vulgar gossip.

290
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.210
You're very sensitive in this respect.

291
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.480
I really admire that.

292
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.690
Did you see my news report?

293
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.370
Don't record our conversation again from now on.

294
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.550
First, I regret to tell you that you should have reported a piece of big news.

295
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.710
Big news?

296
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.090
What's that?

297
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.440
You should have reported it earlier than the foreign press.

298
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.310
Unfortunately, you missed the opportunity.

299
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.540
You mean the case of scientists being kidnapped?

300
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.200
You were caught.

301
00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.580
So you couldn't report it.

302
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.520
It's a state-level secret.

303
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.310
How did you know about it?

304
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.790
Aren't you curious about why you got the information so easily?

305
00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:49.450
<i>Of all the media, why did Hu Xiaoxi give the information to you?</i>

306
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.410
Because I chose you.

307
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.730
<i>I kind of understand this game now.</i>

308
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:04.150
You did well in the game.

309
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.410
I want to talk to you.

310
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.110
<i>Here's the address,</i>

311
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.930
<i>Number Two, Carriage Four.</i>

312
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.430
What do you mean?

313
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.920
It's the only train in Civilization No. 139.

314
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:51.830
I never thought that this civilization had advanced all the way to the Steam Age.

315
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.100
We're lucky.

316
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.320
This time, the Stable Era has lasted a long time.

317
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.580
Civilization No. 138 ended in the Stone Age.

318
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:08.310
I thought Civilization No. 139 would end soon as well, never expecting that it would advance to this level.

319
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.750
I almost forgot what the Chaotic Era was like.

320
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.850
But you're constantly afraid.

321
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.480
I think the purpose of this game

322
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.950
is for us to find the alternation pattern between the Stable Eras and the Chaotic Eras,

323
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.070
or find a way to protect and continue civilization.

324
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.830
Am I right?

325
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.980
Professor Wang, why should civilization advance?

326
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.850
To survive.

327
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.040
Yes.

328
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.310
We spare no effort on observation and calculation,

329
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:42.740
and climb the technology tree in order not to be destroyed.

330
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.310
You've shown me the world of the farmer.

331
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.480
Does that mean I can see the farmer after I pass the game?

332
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.500
The Lord needs you to know him first.

333
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.840
In the game, many people have begun an expedition through the world to observe the suns.

334
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.670
They hope to calculate the distance between us and the sun through time differences.

335
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.170
Do you think they can find a pattern?

336
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.660
I hope they can find it.

337
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.890
But do we still have time?

338
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.590
Sherlock Holmes?

339
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.080
Who are you dressed as?

340
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.220
The Lady of the Camellias?

341
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.520
Madam Butterfly?

342
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.880
You know what, a scientist can be pretty if she's dressed up.

343
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.550
H-How do you like my style?

344
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.200
It suits you.

345
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.870
What took you so long?

346
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:46.820
- Don't mention it.
- Sit down.

347
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.090
The carriage numbers aren't in sequence.

348
00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.930
I got in Number Seven directly from Number Two.

349
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.650
And then I got in Number 42.

350
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.290
I walked back and forth a bunch of times.

351
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.050
You're not interested in the game, are you?

352
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.010
No.

353
00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:01.850
I don't think it's as easy to play as Snake.

354
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:06.500
I don't think you two came to see me just to talk about this, right?

355
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.730
I see.

356
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.800
Actually, you don't have to do this.

357
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.530
You can ask me directly if you want to know who is in our gatherings.

358
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.610
Our gatherings are open.

359
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.740
You don't need to feel bad about handing over that list.

360
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:28.300
If you said that earlier, our talk would have been easier, Dr. Shen.

361
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.940
Our chat in the game doesn't count as an interrogation.

362
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:37.030
I just want to know what happened to those scientists who committed suicide.

363
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.280
I've told you everything I know.

364
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.750
If you want to know more, I can tell you what I understand as well.

365
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.780
It's about to end.

366
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.760
<i>Civilization No. 139 was destroyed by a tri-solar day.</i>

367
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.410
<i>The civilization had advanced to the Steam Age.</i>

368
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:28.300
<i>The seed of civilization remains.</i>

369
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.070
<i>We invite you to log into the game again.</i>

370
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:47.300
<i>[ Nanomaterial Center ]</i>

371
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.170
Let's go.

372
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.030
To see Shen Yufei.

373
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.700
<i>Did you see my news report?</i>

374
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.210
<i>Don't record our conversation again from now on.</i>

375
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:19.560
<i>Mr. Pan, I know you are a famous biologist in the Frontiers of Science.</i>

376
00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.790
<i>Many scientists committed suicide after contacting the group.</i>

377
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.980
What do you think of it?

378
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.960
Suicide isn't worth investigating.

379
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.310
This is.

380
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.820
<i>[ Risk Assessment of Foreign Water Pollution ]
[ Foreign Data on Sulfur Dioxide Pollution ]</i>

381
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.450
Where did you get these?

382
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.410
Who on earth are you?

383
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.790
It doesn't matter who I am.

384
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.750
But when numerous people like you and me are united,

385
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.690
there's a lot of things they can't cover up anymore.

386
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.620
We can help you to do what you want to do.

387
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.860
"We"?

388
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.240
We're very powerful.

389
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.730
By working with us, you'll get more.

390
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.120
So, you aren't a simple biologist.

391
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.680
With a pH value greater than nine, plants can't survive.

392
00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.000
Take a look at the information.

393
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:38.240
How many places are there with a pH value far greater than nine due to industrial pollution?

394
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.170
A simple biologist can't protect those creatures.

395
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.400
So you want me to report these for you?

396
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.440
This will cause a huge shock.

397
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.580
Don't worry.

398
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.690
I won't let them stop me this time.

399
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.240
I'll take care of it.

400
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:22.540
We can't arrest or interrogate her.

401
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.330
Will she tell us the truth?

402
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.100
We'll talk.

403
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.400
If she talks to us, we'll get something eventually.

404
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.980
Is it an interrogation when you question me here?

405
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.390
No, no.

406
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.140
It's just a chat between online friends.

407
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.170
Sit down.

408
00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.450
What do you want to know?

409
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.450
Start from Professor Munphy.

410
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.400
I've told you everything.

411
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.410
I only let him see the truth.

412
00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:56.400
The Liangxiang Collider, Yang Dong tested it three times.

413
00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:00.280
None of the data was the same as her calculations.

414
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.990
According to my consultation, under normal conditions,

415
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.540
even if the three sets of data were different from her calculations,

416
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.710
there shouldn't have been such huge differences between the data.

417
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:16.660
And... the differences...

418
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.400
Were without patterns.

419
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.380
Yeah.

420
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.160
Without any patterns.

421
00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.110
I was wondering, if they couldn't calculate the data

422
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.870
no matter what they did, how could you get them before the experiment?

423
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.650
Munphy showed Yang Dong two copies of data.

424
00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.930
Nine o'clock... Nine o'clock...

425
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.160
What happened at nine?

426
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.340
Ding Yi then consoled her, saying that something might be wrong with the photocopier.

427
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.360
I only sent him faxes.

428
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.540
If he was the one who photocopied them, how could the photocopied faxes show different times?

429
00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.840
Nobody could've gotten the results of your experiment before you conducted it.

430
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.800
It's definitely the machine.

431
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.740
Have some faith in science, okay?

432
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.390
Can a photocopier make mistakes with just the time?

433
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:04.510
Obviously, the explanation wasn't convincing at all.

434
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.730
It was you who gave the data to Munphy in advance.

435
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.400
Yes.

436
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.810
I did give him the data before the experiment.

437
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.250
Did you come up with the results through calculations?

438
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.030
If you did, then physics should still exist.

439
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:31.430
You and I work in applied physics.

440
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.220
We can't calculate them.

441
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.010
Yang Dong and Munphy worked in fundamental physics.

442
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.170
They couldn't either.

443
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:43.900
It shows... that our physics really doesn't exist.

444
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.290
Then who worked them out?

445
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.900
The farmer?

446
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.300
The Lord knows everything.

447
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.920
The Lord?

448
00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.940
Are you talking about one person or a group of people?

449
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.930
It doesn't matter.

450
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.210
Was it a big deal to get that data?

451
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.470
Sorry.

452
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.400
There's no smoking here.

453
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.100
Professor Wang will answer your question.

454
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.050
I dropped this box of cigarettes three times in a row.

455
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.220
Same cigarettes.

456
00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.530
Same amount.

457
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:55.650
Do you think that where each cigarette lands can be exactly the same each time?

458
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.280
It's impossible.

459
00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.710
If I ask you to mark the position of each cigarette

460
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:06.410
each time in advance, can you do that?

461
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:08.390
Even more impossible.

462
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:09.300
Do you understand now?

463
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.840
Yes.

464
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.090
But just say it, you didn't have to throw my cigarettes.

465
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.090
So,

466
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:24.010
Munphy killed himself because he couldn't accept this, right?

467
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.650
He killed himself because he accepted the truth.

468
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.330
It's done.

469
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.900
All this nonsense.

470
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.020
I see.

471
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.980
His faith collapsed.

472
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.420
What about Yang Dong then?

473
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.810
Honestly,

474
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.840
I didn't know Yang Dong well.

475
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.740
After the experiment, we talked on the phone.

476
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.460
I thought she had accepted the fact that physics might not exist.

477
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.480
Afterward, she didn't give up on her life.

478
00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:08.940
She changed her job and even thought about getting married.

479
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.610
You gave her a file packet before.

480
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.570
Five days after that, she killed herself.

481
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:27.710
If you looked into it, you should know what was inside.

482
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:31.930
If I was really a suspect, I wouldn't be sitting here now.

483
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.090
What was in the packet?

484
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.210
A recommendation letter.

485
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.150
She recommended Yang Dong to work in a research institute.

486
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:46.250
So are you suggesting Yang Dong's suicide had nothing to do with the fact physics didn't exist anymore?

487
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.990
I don't understand it either,

488
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:55.090
why Yang Dong made such a choice ten months after the experiment failed.

489
00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.050
Physics has never existed, and will never exist.

490
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:01.840
Correct.

491
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.780
Those were Yang Dong's last words.

492
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.980
I can understand why Munphy killed himself, but I don't understand Yang Dong.

493
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.710
I did show those scientists the truth,

494
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:19.150
but I couldn't interfere with their choice.

495
00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:23.060
Did your Lord ask you to do so?

496
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:28.030
The Lord has revealed the truth to us.

497
00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.760
That's why he's the Lord.

498
00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:42.040
