(But the waveform that night
was different.)

19
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.790
(It was hard to tell with the naked eye
if a waveform carried information.)

20
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.760
(But I was so familiar with the waveform)
(of the noise of the universe.)

21
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.150
(I realized
the wave moving in front of me)

22
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.870
(had been modulated by intelligence.)

23
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.470
(No radio signals we had received)

24
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.840
(exceeded C-level recognizability.)

25
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.240
(Were it an A, the likelihood that the
transmission contained intelligent information)

26
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.130
(would be above 90 percent.)

27
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.710
(The rating of that one was AAAAA.)

28
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.080
(That was extremely unusual,)

29
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.960
(which meant
that the received transmission)

30
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.340
(used the same coding language
as Red Coast's outbound transmission.)

31
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.060

(I am a pacifist in this world.)

43
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.390
(It is the luck of your civilization)

44
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.720
(that I am the first
to receive your message.)

45
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.680

(Do not answer.)

49
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.950
(There are tens of millions of stars
in your direction.)

50
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.720
(As long as you do not answer,)

51
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.630
(this world will not be able to ascertain
the source of your transmission.)

52
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.800
(But if you do answer,
the source will be located right away.)

53
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.240
(Your planet will be invaded.)

54
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.620
(Your world will be conquered.)

55
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.390
Do not answer.

56
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.890
Do not answer.

57
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.690
Do not answer.

58
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.510
When I received the first message,
no more than nine years had passed

59
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.000
since the time I had sent the message
to the sun.

60
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.510
Then the source of this transmission
must be around four light-years away.

61
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:57.830
It could only have come from
the closest extra-solar stellar system,

62
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.720
Alpha Centauri.

63
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.430
In the four hours after that day,

64
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.950
for the first time,

65
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.220
I learned of the existence
of another world,

66
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.770
of Trisolaris.

67
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.920
(As you know,)

68
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.130
(that is the civilization that
had been reborn again and again.)

69
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.780
Of course

70
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.230
I also learned
of their plan to migrate to the stars.

71
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.170
(No one noticed this.)

72
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.720
(In the data analysis section
of the monitoring system,)

73
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.790
(only the two terminals in front of me)

74
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.440
(could view the recognizability rating
of a signal)

75
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.080
(and access the deciphering system.)

76
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.390
(I moved all of the received messages
to a multiply-encrypted,)

77
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.270
(invisible subdirectory.)

78
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.150
(Then I copied over a segment of noise
received a year ago)

79
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.460
(as a substitute for the transmission
received during the last five hours.)

80
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.250
(Later, I went to the main control room
of transmission.)

81
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.870
(All units are to fill in
the work logs carefully.)

82
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.390
(All unit heads are to attend the regular
meeting in the meeting room. Over.)

83
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.960
(According to
the latest weather forecast,)

84
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.000
(from 8:00 AM today
to 8:00 AM tomorrow,)

85
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.270
(the highest temperature)

86
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.720
(in part of the Northeast
will be nine degrees Celsius.)

87
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.270
(The lowest temperature will be
minus three degrees Celsius.)

88
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.750
(Sunny to overcast.)

89
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.050
(Northwest wind at Level Three.)

90
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.130
(At 5:00 this afternoon,
the transmission unit...)

91
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.020
(1979)

92
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.860
(Latitude)

93
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.740
(Longitude)

94
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.050
(Come here.)

95
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.010
(I will help you conquer this world.)

96
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.630
(Our civilization is no longer capable of
solving its own problems.)

97
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.170
(We need your force to intervene.)

98
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.700
Why don't you tell me?

99
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.290
Wenjie,
don't be burdened with thoughts.

100
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:35.290
You can tell me anything.

101
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.200
We can shoulder everything together.

102
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.460
Do you know how dangerous it was

103
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.580
for you to be unconscious out there?

104
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.460
You've known everything?

105
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.320
You're pregnant. It's such a big deal.
Why don't you tell me?

106
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.580
Why?

107
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.130
Tell me.

108
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.870
I became a mother

109
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.940
that day.

110
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.120
My daughter
is Yang Dong.

111
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.550
It might be a coincidence.

112
00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.790
From that day on,

113
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.600
both my life

114
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:09.220
and the history of human civilization
had a fresh start.

115
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.530
Wang,

116
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.230
now,

117
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.880
I will answer your question.

118
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.830
Why does Lord
have to extinguish nanomaterial?

119
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.070
Because it can allow humans
to escape gravity

120
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.420
and engage in space construction
at a much larger scale.

121
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.420
The space elevator?

122
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.550
You immediately
think of the space elevator

123
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.790
from Flying Blade.

124
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.240
This may be but a tiny invention.

125
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.350
But for humans on Earth,
its meaning would be significant.

126
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.290
If ultrastrong nanomaterials
could be mass produced,

127
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.550
(then that would lay
the technical foundation)

128
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.590
(for building a space elevator)

129
00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.920
(from the ground
up to a geostationary point in space.)

130
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.640
(With this technology,)

131
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.070
(humans could easily enter
near-Earth space)

132
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.400
(and build up
large-scale defensive structures.)

133
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.440
This will affect the advent of the Lord.

134
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.240
Thus, this technology
must be extinguished.

135
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.880
This is useless.

136
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.790
This is not basic research.

137
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.920
Based on what we've already found out,
someone else can figure out the rest.

138
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.880
It's far more effective
to confuse the researchers' minds.

139
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.790
(It is a countdown like this.)

140
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.420
(It goes on and on before my eyes,
second by second, without missing a beat.)

141
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.510
What is at the end of the countdown?

142
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.070
What?

143
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:16.070
Like you point out,
this is applied research after all,

144
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.670
not as effective as basic research.

145
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.140
Basic research?

146
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.310
(All the evidence
points to a single conclusion.)

147
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.960
(Physics has never existed,)

148
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.400
(and will never exist.)

149
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.980
(I know what I'm doing
is irresponsible.)

150
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.030
(But I have no choice.)

151
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.980
Physics does not exist.

152
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.660
Yang Dong.

153
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.700
How did she die?

154
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.660
Captain, we've arrived at
the place outside as planned.

155
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.310
Move.

156
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.940
All units, move!

157
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.960
Indeed, compared to our Lord
who possesses peerless strength,

158
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.180
everything we do is meaningless.

159
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.310
(Everything's ready.
Please give instructions.)

160
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.160
Move now.

161
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.220
Move.

162
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.070
What happened?

163
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.090
What's wrong?

164
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.480
Everyone, freeze! Keep down!

165
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.200
(Squad One has got in.)

166
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.110
(Report!)

167
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.030
(-The east side is under control.
- Report!)

168
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.070
(The north side is under control.)

169
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.510
(Squad Two, watch carefully outside.)

170
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.720
(Don't let a single one of them go.)

171
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.240
(Got it.)

172
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:32.960
(Report!)

173
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.790
(Our observation says
there are five to six firearm holders.)

174
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.030
(We don't know yet)

175
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.180
(if they have other weapons.)

176
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.680
(Is Professor Wang safe?)

177
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.850
(Yes.)

178
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.880
Professor Wang.

179
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.700
Professor Wang, follow me.

180
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.960
(Report!)

181
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.460
(All of them are under control.)

182
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.880
(Attention, all units.)

183
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.920
(Except for the five people,
including Ye Wenjie and Chen Xue,)

184
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.440
(other people are all under control.)

185
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.200
(Chen Xue and the other two
are holding unknown objects.)

186
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.000
(They may be dangerous.)

187
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.720
Don't move!

188
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.270
Keep down! Keep down!

189
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.590
It won't be fun if you move again.

190
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.350
Hand over your weapons.

191
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.500
I swear I'm going to kill
the next bonehead who tries anything.

192
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.160
I know that none of you is afraid to die,
but we're not afraid either.

193
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.790
I'm going to say this up front.

194
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:48.030
Normal police procedures and laws
don't apply to you.

195
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:53.640
Even the human laws of warfare
no longer apply to you.

196
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.270
Since you've decided to treat
the entire human race as your enemy,

197
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:01.290
there's no longer anything
we wouldn't do to you.

198
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.330
Officers,

199
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.440
we hold in our hands
three nuclear bombs.

200
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.880
(Report! There are nuclear weapons.)

201
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.880
(Repeat! There are nuclear weapons.)

202
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.790
Don't move.

203
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.480
Keep down!

204
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.640
Keep down!

205
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.070
Keep down!

206
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.960
Everyone, keep down!

207
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.200
Professor Wang, leave here
as soon as possible.

208
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.720
Each of them is with a yield
of about one point five kilotons.

209
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.830
This is the detonator.

210
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.200
Snipers,
look for a favorable firing position.

211
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.070
Chief Commander, please allow me
to find another firing position.

212
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.180
(Allowed.)

213
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.900
Our demand is simple.

214
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.240
Let Commander go.

215
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.070
Then we can play whatever game you want.

216
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.180
I stay with my comrades.

217
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.010
(Snipers, get in position now.)

218
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.980
Is it truly a nuclear bomb?

219
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.400
I think it's just a ball.

220
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.050
- Do you want to have a try?
- Don't!

221
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Snipers' sight is obstructed.

222
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.680
The first shoot can't be guaranteed.

223
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.920
There's another way.

224
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.070
We can shoot the sphere.

225
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.640
Won't that set off the bomb?

226
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.160
(The conventional explosives
around the outside will go off,)

227
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.680
but it won't lead to
a nuclear explosion.

228
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.440
Leave her to me.

229
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.440
What tricks are you trying to play?

230
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.270
We need to have a talk.

231
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.750
Don't move. Don't follow me.

232
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.960
Stop.

233
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.920
Calm down.

234
00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.740
I believe I have some information
you'll definitely want to know.

235
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.140
Your mom has been found.

236
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.460
Your mother has been found.

237
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.610
Your mom's letter.

238
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.700
Which one of you will come and take it?

239
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.030
(Radiation!)

240
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.680
(Run!)

241
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.310
(Run!)

242
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.420
(Run!)

243
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.880
Radiation! Go!

244
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.140
Go!

245
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.180
Hurry!

246
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.420
Put down the gun!

247
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:25.550
Put down

248
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.500
the gun!

249
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.900
Put down the gun.

250
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.640
(Protect the site.)

251
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.790
(Count the casualties.)

252
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:09.960
(Is the ambulance here?)

253
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.640
(Get the injured to the hospital now.)

254
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.270
(Roger.)

255
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.290
(Roger.)

256
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.880
(All units, attention.)

257
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.790
(Cooperate with medical staff
and clean up the radiation.)

258
00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.270
(All surveyors on the site
should wear protection suits.)

259
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.200
(Protect yourselves.)

260
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.590
(Yes.)

261
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:27.810
(All brigade members,
please take personal precautions.)

262
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.090
(Here. Here.)

263
00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.480
How are you?

264
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.720
It's nothing.

265
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.160
Just some superficial injuries. I'm fine.

266
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.420
You call using a pistol
against a nuclear bomb nothing?

267
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.500
Do you think it's enough for me
to brag about it for ten years?

268
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.790
It's enough for you to brag about
for your whole life.

269
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.330
That's worth it then.

270
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.790
Okay.

271
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.350
Are you also hurt?

272
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.740
Have a rest.

273
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.880
Shi Qiang.

274
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.770
That's okay.

275
00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.500
Roger.

276
00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.420
These are not superficial injuries.

277
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.310
You detonated a nuclear bomb
five meters away.

278
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.700
What will kill you is the radiation.

279
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.240
I don't know
if it's a blessing or a curse.

280
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:36.420
If it's a curse,
I believe a smile would let it go.

281
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.270
Are all scientists in position?

282
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.360
They're ready
in the adjacent surveillance room

283
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.210
to provide you with technical support
at any time.

284
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.590
My name is Chang Weisi.

285
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.900
Let's get started.

286
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.260
Name?

287
00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.590
Ye Wenjie.

288
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.670
Birth date?

289
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:10.070
June 1947.

290
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.670
Employment?

291
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.840
(Professor of Astrophysics
at Tsinghua University.)

292
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.110
(Retired in 2004.)

293
00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.880
(Professor Ye,)

294
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.440
given your health condition,

295
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:28.480
you can request a break at any time.

296
00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.320
Thank you.

297
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.420
There's no need.

298
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.320
(First, we need to conduct
a regular criminal investigation)

299
00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.590
(and won't get into
more sensitive matters.)

300
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.800
(That's not the major part
of this investigation.)

301
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.440
(We would like to finish quickly.)

302
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.960
(We hope you'll cooperate.)

303
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.880
I know what you're referring to.

304
00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.840
Yes, I'll cooperate.

305
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.070
Our investigation revealed

306
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.110
that while you were working
at Red Coast Base,

307
00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.940
you were suspected of murder.

308
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.860
I did kill two people.

309
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.400
(When?)

310
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.070
(The afternoon
of October 21, 1979.)

311
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.780
(Names of the victims?)

312
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.320
Political Commissar Lei Zhicheng,

313
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.670
and my husband, Chief Engineer

314
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.550
Yang Weining.

315
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.190
(Explain your motive for murder.)

316
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:44.510
Can I assume that you understand

317
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.070
the relevant information?

318
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.800
We know the basics.

319
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.860
If something is unclear, we'll ask you.

320
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:56.300
Good.

321
00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.670
(It had been eight years
since I sent a signal to the earth.)

322
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:05.510
(On October 21, 1979,)

323
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.500
(Do not answer)
(OS: I received a message from Trisolaris.)

324
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.420
"Do not

325
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.320
answer".

326
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.710
(On the day when I
received the message and replied,)

327
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.800
(Lei Zhicheng called me to his office.)

328
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.440
(I learned that at that time,)

329
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.550
(I wasn't the only one)

330
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.190
(to get the message
from Trisolaran Civilization.)

331
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:36.400
(Lei got it as well.)

332
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.920
(Unbeknownst to everyone,
he had been running a secret program)

333
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.960
(on the main computer for a long time.)

334
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.280
(He had a copy of everything)

335
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.510
(Red Coast sent and received.)

336
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.940
(It was from this copy)

337
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.320
(Do not answer)
(OS: that he discovered)

338
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.820
(the extraterrestrial message
that Red Coast received.)

339
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.280
Ye Wenjie, I really didn't think
you would do such a thing.

340
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.150
Eight hours have passed

341
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.480
since you received the first message.

342
00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.280
Instead of making a report,

343
00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.730
you deleted the original message
and maybe hid a copy privately.

344
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.500
Isn't that right?

345
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.530
I know your next move.

346
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.900
You plan to reply, right?

347
00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.670
If I hadn't discovered this in time,

348
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:54.300
you could have ruined
all human civilization!

349
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.030
Of course,

350
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.150
I'm not saying
that we're afraid of an interstellar invasion.

351
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.780
Even if we assumed the worst
and that really did happen,

352
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.590
the outer space invaders

353
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.670
would surely drown in the ocean
of the people's righteous war.

354
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.530
This is indisputable.

355
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:20.780
(I realized then that he didn't know
that I'd already replied.)

356
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:25.920
(When I placed the answer
into the transmission buffer,)

357
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.690
(I didn't use the regular file interface.)

358
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.030
(Luckily, this got around
his monitoring program.)

359
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.360
(I was thinking about
how to let Lei Zhicheng believe me)

360
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.610
(and cover up all this.)

361
00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.670
Ye Wenjie, I knew you were capable
of doing something like this.

362
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:59.980
Because you've always held a deep hatred
toward those who once hurt you.

363
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.420
You would seize
any opportunity for revenge.

364
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.460
But have you considered
the consequences of your action?

365
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.530
I was too afraid.

366
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.110
That's why I didn't make a report.

367
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.980
Too scared?

368
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.110
Ye Wenjie,

369
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.960
to be honest,
I have no pity for you at all.

370
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.510
But I cannot bear to see Yang Weining
ruined along with you,

371
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.500
and I certainly cannot allow his child
to be ruined as well.

372
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.530
You're pregnant, right?

373
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.380
You will soon be a mother.

374
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.440
I'm telling you. Even though Yang Weining
had nothing to do with this,

375
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.670
your deeds would certainly implicate him
if revealed.

376
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.800
Just like you were implicated
by your father your whole life.

377
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.330
And your unborn baby's whole life
would also be implicated by you.

378
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.500
Have you thought about these?

379
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.690
Wenjie,

380
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.530
have a seat.

381
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:32.800
This must be taken care of.

382
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.460
But there's still a silver lining.

383
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.800
Luckily, only you and I
know what happened.

384
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:49.440
What we must do is to minimize the impact

385
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.860
of your actions.

386
00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:56.670
From now on,
don't mention this to anyone,

387
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.480
including Yang Weining.

388
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.010
I will

389
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.860
take care of the rest.

390
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.320
Wenjie, you must believe me.

391
00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.550
Weining has been my comrades
for so many years.

392
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:19.800
We have a deep personal friendship.
I have to help him with this.

393
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.230
As long as you cooperate,

394
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:25.420
you can avoid
the disastrous consequences.

395
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:33.360
(At that moment,
I knew what Lei Zhicheng was after.)

396
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.110
(He wanted to become)

397
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:39.090
(the first man to discover
extraterrestrial intelligence.)

398
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.670
(It really was a great opportunity to get
his name into the history textbooks.)

399
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:47.280
Once he reported this,

400
00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.190
my reply would soon be discovered.

401
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.590
(Humans would exhaust all technological
and military power)

402
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.940
(to stop Trisolarans from coming.)

403
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.550
(I assented.)

404
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:05.940
(But at that time,)

405
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.780
(I'd already decided everything.)
