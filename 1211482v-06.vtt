2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.140
What's this?

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600
See for yourself.

4
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.730
Look in the middle.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.290
What's this?

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.030
Countdown.

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.500
Where did you get these?

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.110
Wang Miao took them.

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.130
Every one of them was taken by him.

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.720
Every one has that thing on it.

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.600
When did he start taking these?

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.190
This is the first time.

13
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.970
Prior to this, it only appeared in pictures. But now, it's right in front of him.

14
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.300
I mean, he sees that countdown when he looks at things. It's there all the time.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.870
Chang, while you're checking these out, I'll fill you in on something.

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.530
I used to have a colleague named Old Tian.

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.070
I think you know him.

18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.200
He has a habit.

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.280
Every time, before he went on a mission,

20
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.920
he'd first check the total number of the cigarettes in his cigarette pack.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
It had to be an odd number.

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.360
If was even, he'll pull one out before he left.

23
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.350
Don't smoke in here.

24
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.640
Strangely enough, as long as there was an odd number, he caught the suspect every time.

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.090
On one occasion, after he checked his cigarettes, I stealthily pulled one out.

26
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.650
Guess what?

27
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.100
On that day, he cornered the suspect at a dead end,

28
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.070
but somehow the he climbed over the wall and escaped.

29
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.390
Because of that, I didn't get any cigarettes from Tian for two months.

30
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.470
Chang, do you think this...

31
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.950
has anything to do with the case?

32
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.020
Then what did Wang Miao do that had nothing to do with the countdown?

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.860
Wang Miao shut down the nano-experiment, and the countdown disappeared.

34
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.450
I've always said that anything sufficiently weird must be fishy,

35
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.310
but this time around, this fishy thing's way too unusual.

36
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.230
Do you know who told him to shut down the experiment?

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.200
Shen Yufei.

<i>[Episode 6]</i>

55
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.970
It's very weird that I, a would-be Buddhist, raise chickens, right?

56
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.030
I heard that chicken used to be your favorite food.

57
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.410
Yeah.

58
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.730
A student of mine, who didn't know I'd converted to Buddhism,

59
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.030
came to visit. He actually brought me a couple of chickens.

60
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.490
I couldn't eat them, even if I wanted to, so I had no choice but to keep them.

61
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.260
You see, now they've become so many.

62
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.960
It's not weird.

63
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.770
I'm a scientist but I pray quite often.

64
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.550
I wonder if these chickens know it is me who's been feeding them.

65
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.290
Just like I don't know if the deity you pray to can see your piety or not.

66
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.200
I mean, can the whole universe see your piety or not?

67
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.500
It flickers with a crackling sound,

68
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.560
and Shen Yufei told Wang Miao beforehand when it would flicker.

69
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.720
The rhythm of its flickering was a code.

70
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.070
After the code was deciphered,

71
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.320
it was still counting down.

72
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.680
Do you guys raise chickens in Pastoral China?

73
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.560
That plan was made by Pan Han and some others.

74
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260
I have nothing to do with it.

75
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.790
I heard he threw people back into the natural environment

76
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.740
to reduce consumption and trash.

77
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.410
You don't like his method of environmental protection?

78
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.460
What's the point of that?

79
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.910
Humans will never give up city life and get back to nature.

80
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.260
Only a small number of people have seen through the emptiness of earthly life.

81
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.160
What is this countdown exactly?

82
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.960
Where does it come from?

83
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.820
And what will happen when it ends?

84
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.100
That's what I'm going to find out.

85
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.530
Old Chang,

86
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.960
what should we do with Wang Miao?

87
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.770
Shen Yufei put a lot of work into him.

88
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.740
Her efforts will not be in vain.

89
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.010
But don't worry.

90
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.990
Wang Miao is definitely our key to finding the truth.

91
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.650
That's right.

92
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.930
All right.

93
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.650
My report is over.

94
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.980
I understand.

95
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.970
You left me an odd number.

96
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.500
I'm leaving.

97
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.040
How does it feel to see through the emptiness of earthly life?

98
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.380
Not interesting.

99
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.190
You guys think I'm boring.

100
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.060
I think your guys are also boring.

101
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.800
So...

102
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.460
this is very interesting!

103
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.270
Interesting!

104
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.600
Professor Peng, I'm Chang Weisi.

105
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.660
I have a question for you.

106
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.200
Can the universe flicker?

107
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.180
We have the European, North American, African, and all the other major combat zones.

108
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.040
Send those pictures to them right now.

109
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.400
Okay.

110
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.870
I'm sorry everyone that I kept you waiting.

111
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.160
The latest news

112
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.430
happened a moment ago. Another exceptional case occurred in the Asian Combat Zone.

113
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.060
Another scientist's suicide?

114
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.290
No.

115
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.720
Someone saw a countdown.

116
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.830
A countdown?

117
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.920
You mean, like, the ones in the photographs?

118
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.050
Were they printed?

119
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.430
They're not printed.

120
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.550
We haven't verified how they came into being.

121
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.160
Those in the pictures... are only in a preliminary form.

122
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.360
What do you mean?

123
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.110
Are they projected or are there other carriers?

124
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.610
It's somewhat bizarre.

125
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.620
I should say this is something we've never seen before.

126
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.930
It's on his retina.

127
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.290
What? Undercover?

128
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.170
That's one way to put it.

129
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.160
You see, all those things

130
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.380
have something to do with Shen Yufei and the Frontiers of Science.

131
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.600
Shen Yufei came to you.

132
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.370
If you don't go undercover, do you think they'll come to me someday?

133
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:13.290
I used to think the Frontiers of Science was just an academic organization.

134
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.920
But I see it differently now.

135
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.450
What do you mean by "differently"?

136
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.750
I don't know how to explain it clearly,

137
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.830
but I know very well that they're desperate to have me accept a hard truth.

138
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.610
And it's that no matter whether we're eating, chatting,

139
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.010
or improving civilization, developing science and technology,

140
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.790
or deepening our understanding of this society,

141
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.710
it doesn't change the fact that we're just a flock of turkeys on a neglected farm.

142
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.770
Even so, you're an undercover science-savvy turkey.

143
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.850
I'm not like you. I'm a bodyguard turkey.

144
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.680
Don't worry.

145
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.560
I'll always be there for you.

146
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.580
You'll never understand what I've been through,

147
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.570
or what I'm going through.

148
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.940
Here.

149
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.430
Look here.

150
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.000
Don't be afraid.

151
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.600
I had a friend make this for me.

152
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.600
I told him I wanted a super-long countdown timer.

153
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.500
He's an expert bomb maker who blows up things.

154
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.000
This is the best he can do.

155
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.500
I...

156
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.000
I don't know what your countdown is about.

157
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.400
Anyway, here's the point.

158
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.800
Wang Miao, if your time is up, mine will be up as well.

159
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.800
Do you understand?

160
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.600
Come on.

161
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.000
Let's set the clock.

162
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.800
You're cross-eyed.

163
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.600
Are the countdown numbers very close to each other?

164
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.000
Not that close.

165
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.600
Tell me. What is it?

166
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.000
One, zero, one, eight,

167
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
four, five, two.

168
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.400
One.

169
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.070
Zero.

170
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.200
One. Eight.

171
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.500
Four. Five. Two.

172
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.300
All right.

173
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.000
Tell me when it's double four.

174
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.500
I'll press the button at the same time

175
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.000
and the countdown will start.

176
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.070
Five.

177
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.960
Four.

178
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960
Three.

179
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960
Two.

180
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.070
One.

181
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.200
Are they the same?

182
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.700
Yeah.

183
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.800
Okay.

184
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.000
Done.

185
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.200
Look.

186
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.700
It's barely visible.

187
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.700
The experiment was restarted.

188
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.600
When will you finish the Flying Knife?

189
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.500
It's "Flying Blade".

190
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.200
What's the difference?

191
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.300
Currently, nano Flying Blades are made with molecular construction techniques,

192
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.500
but it's very resource-intensive.

193
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.600
Right now what we're trying to do

194
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.000
is develop a catalytic reaction as a substitute for molecular construction.

195
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.800
Can you translate those words for me?

196
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.600
I mean, use a language I can understand.

197
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.200
The experiment hasn't succeeded yet.

198
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.000
We still need to work on it.

199
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.400
Can you get the job done before it ends?

200
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.300
I mean, the countdown.

201
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.500
I don't know.

202
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.300
You said the countdown halted when you stopped the experiment.

203
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.200
Is it possible that this is a countdown to your success?

204
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.200
I mean, can it be that you'll succeed at the end of the countdown?

205
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.200
Your way of speaking is scientifically very unreasonable,

206
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.200
but there have been too many unreasonable things lately.

207
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.900
Just tell me if seeing it this way cheers you up.

208
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.400
Munphy also talked to Shen Yufei before his death.

209
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.200
<i>If you're right, all those who had dealings with Shen Yufei</i>

210
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.000
have either joined the Frontiers of Science or committed suicide.

211
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Not all of them.

212
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You're still alive, aren't you?

213
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.100
That's why you need to join it.

214
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.400
Apart from me, are there any other survivors?

215
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.300
Yes.

216
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.100
Yang Dong's mother.

217
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.600
During the investigation,

218
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:58.200
I originally thought that Shen Yufei got close to Ye Wenjie for Yang Dong.

219
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.400
It doesn't seem to be the case because Ye Wenjie is also scientist.

220
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.200
She's alive, and so are you.

221
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.900
You two survivors don't seem to follow any of the patterns.

222
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.800
Do you think it's possible Ye Wenjie can see the countdown as well?

223
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.200
Probably not.

224
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.800
<i> The other day, when I went to observe cosmic background radiation,</i>

225
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.100
<i> she helped contact her student for me.</i>

226
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.300
If she could also see the countdown, she should know what I was there for.

227
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.800
You've looked into Ye Wenjie, right?

228
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.500
I checked.

229
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.800
There's nothing out of the ordinary, except she didn't commit suicide.

230
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.200
This place used to be the museum warehouse.

231
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.600
It's very roomy.

232
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.300
Now it's your office.

233
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.100
A warehouse?

234
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.200
It's pretty nice.

235
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.200
Being big enough is the whole point.

236
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.400
There will be more than a dozen people, after all. They need enough space.

237
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.700
You've already started working?

238
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.000
General.

239
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.200
Let me introduce you.

240
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200
The introduction can wait.

241
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.300
You should wait until everybody's here.

242
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.000
It'll save you the trouble of repeat introductions.

243
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.500
Everyone's here.

244
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400
Xu Bingbing

245
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.000
transferred here from CID.

246
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.800
She's worth ten agents.

247
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.400
What do you mean by "Everyone's here"?

248
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.600
How do you know she's worth ten agents?

249
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600
Why should I believe you?

250
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.300
Chang, how can you do this?

251
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.200
You're such a high-ranking general.

252
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.300
How could you go back on your word?

253
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.800
Do I need to have you write down every promise you make me?

254
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.700
Are you done talking?

255
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.200
You don't want her?

256
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.400
I'll take her away then.

257
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.800
Go, go, go.

258
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.300
Wait.

259
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.600
You can't leave.

260
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.200
I'm not letting her leave unless you get me the 10 people as promised.

261
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.400
I need a hostage.

262
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.600
All right.

263
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.700
Stop it.

264
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.700
I asked Chang for information specialists, not cleaners.

265
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.060
<i>[ Ye Wenjie ]</i>

266
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.460
<i>[ Mu Xing ]</i>

267
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.100
Ye Wenjie, astrophysicist.

268
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.600
Mu Xing, reporter and freelance media worker.

269
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.600
That's all?

270
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.100
I'm giving you four hours to gather everything you can on these two people.

271
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.800
All right.

272
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.600
This job requires at least two people.

273
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.200
This lists the names of all the scientists we need to investigate.

274
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.900
I want all the detailed information about them and their family members!

275
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.200
It must be done today!

276
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.300
All right.

277
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.800
And clean this room. I want it spotless.

278
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.900
Don't say, "All right." Say,  "Yes."

279
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.600
Understood.

280
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.200
Yes.

281
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:38.100
<i> Reporters have learned from the meeting held on the 13th about the assignment of tasks</i>

282

283
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.800
Dad, do you feel better?

284
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.600
Doudou put the eye drops in Dad's eyes, and Dad's eyes feel much better now.

285
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.200
You two, the rice is done and the fish will be ready in two minutes.

286
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
- Doudou, go wash your hands and eat.
- Get ready to eat.

287
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.300
Hurry.

288
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600
Wash your hands clean, Doudou.

289
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.400
Li Yao, you and Doudou may eat without me.

290
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.400
I have an errand to run.

291
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.600
What errand do you have to run at mealtime?

292
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.200
You're going out, Dad?

293
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.000
Yes.

294
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.600
Dr. Doudou cured Dad's eye disease, so now Dad has to go to work.

295
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.600
I think Dad hasn't fully recovered yet.

296
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.100
The treatment has to continue.

297
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.400
You still don't get it?

298
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.800
Your daughter wants you to stay at home a bit longer.

299
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.600
Right, Doudou?

300
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.600
Dad will stay at home and keep Doudou company for many days after finishing this job.

301
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.400
Be good. Sit there and eat.

302
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.300
All right. Come and eat. Come on.

It can't be done yet.

You're so accurate. Are you a stopwatch or something?

308
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.600
You're just too tense and too punctual.

309

It's bad for your health.

310

I have an appointment with an old expert today.

I can't be late.

Doudou, bye bye.

313
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.200
Bye bye. See you later, Dad.

314
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.300
- I've got to go. 
 - All right.

Thank you for your hard work.

You're welcome,  Teacher Ye.

318
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600
All right, thanks.

319
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.800
Let me help you with this.

320
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.300
By the way, Teacher Ye, a few days ago, I met a scientist. Her name's Shen Yufei.

321
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.800
Have you ever heard of her?

322
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.900
It rings a bell.

323
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.000
Maybe I saw her at some kind of event.

324
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.800
If my memory serves me well, she specializes in nanotechnology like you do.

325
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.200
Yeah.

326
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.300
By the way, the other day, when you went to the observatory, Sha Ruishan gave me a call.

327
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.300
He said you guys spotted some rather unscientific stuff.

328
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.900
That's right.

329
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.200
This is exactly what I want to consult you about.

330
00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.200
You specialize in astrophysics.

331
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.700
In your experience, do you think it's possible for the universe to flicker?

332
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.300
According to what we know, that's impossible.

333
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.000
What about what we don't know?

334
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.400
When science goes beyond our comprehension,

335
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.500
it usually gets mistaken for heresy.

336
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.800
That's why it throws people into panic.

337
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.600
In human history,

338
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.200
science caused panic...

339
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.200
many times.

340
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.800
During the Renaissance in Europe, Copernicus was persecuted and repressed

341
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.300
by the Church for his heliocentric theory.

342
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.600
When "The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies" was published,

343
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.400
he only stroked its cover before passing away.

344
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:04.800
Bruno supported the heliocentric theory and was burned at the stake by the Church.

345
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:11.500
Cecco d'Ascoli, an astronomer, believed that the earth was round, and he was burned alive as well.

346
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.700
The theories that we see as common sense today

347
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.700
served only to cause great panic among the public in that era.

348
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.000
Just like the many problems we're faced with today.

349
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.300
In the future, when we look back on them, we'll find them as unsurprising as the fact that the earth is round.

350
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.200
Mu Xing returned from overseas only half a year ago.

351
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.800
She's in the new media industry.

352
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.700
Her reports are mainly about science and technology and environmental protection.

353
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.600
She's very aggressive in getting exposure in newspapers.

354
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.300
She once exaggerated the facts to create hot topics.

355
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.400
But some of her reports did bring attention to the issues and fix some of the problems. 
 <i>[ Portfolio ]</i>

356
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.300
Nothing else?

357
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.900
All information about Ye Wenjie is here,

358
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.100
including some deciphered files and some info about her father. 
 <i>[ Ye Wenjie ]</i>

359
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.200
They're all in here.

360
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200
These are profiles about all the scientists on the list

361
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.600
and on the family members of some of the scientists who committed suicide.

362
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.200
I don't think this information have any special value,

363
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.600
but I looked into everything you asked me to look into.

364
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.800
All right.

365
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.800
If this task was assigned to ten people, it would definitely have been a waste of manpower.

366
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.800
In the observatory, there's a guy named Sha Ruishan.

367
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.000
- Heâ€” 
 - I know.

368
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.800
He's Ye Wenjie's student.

369
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.000
He went to observe cosmic flicker with Wang Miao a few days ago.

370
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.200
I'll investigate.

371
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.200
Here's my cell number.

372
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.800
My phone's on twenty-four seven.

373
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.800
If anything happens, you may call me anytime.

374
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.700
Yes.

375
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.300
All right.

376
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.000
Who are you looking for?

377
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.500
So you're Sha Ruishan?

378
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.800
How do you know?

379
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.200
The other day, Professor Wang Miao paid you a visit.

380
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.600
I need to verify a few things with you.

381
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.600
Who are you?

382
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.700
<i>[ Xu Bingbing, CID of Beijing Public Security Bureau ]</i>

383
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.800
I want some information about cosmic flickering.

384
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.200
Are you saying even if Ye Wenjie knows she's a turkey,

385
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.400
she'll feel it's unsurprising?

386
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:02.300
We only talked for a short time, but I feel much calmer.

387
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.800
No matter whether those theories of the Frontiers of Science are right or wrong,

388
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.800
I find them acceptable now.

389
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.200
Maybe we just don't know who we are exactly.

390
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.800
Just like Schrodinger's cat.

391
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.700
I know about cats.

392
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.600
Lately I've learn a lot about physics.

393
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.000
It's about putting a cat into a box, isn't it?

394
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.700
And when you open it, it's either dead or alive.

395
00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.400
But isn't that frivolous?

396
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.800
It's just an experiment with a lot of constants and variables.

397
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.500
In other words, it's a process of finding proof and seeking confirmation.

398
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.600
Is that necessary?

399
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.900
What if the third possibility happens?

400
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.100
That'll be like seeing a ghost.

401
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.600
It'll mean physics no longer exists.

402
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.800
Does Ye Wenjie believe it?

403
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.800
She believes...

404
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.100
our physics might have ceased to exist.

405
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.500
<i> Physics didn't cease to exist.</i>

406
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.800
<i> It's just the physics we know might be non-existent.</i>

407
00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.100
<i> Many years from now, history will reveal the answer.</i>

408
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.400
<i> We might be Copernicus, Bruno,</i>

409
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.200
<i> or the Church.</i>

410
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.800
<i> Or maybe we're nothing.</i>

411
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.400
Come. I'll show you something.

412
00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.800
Come on.

413
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.100
None of the data has problems, but this is impossible.

414
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.500
Even the explosion of a supernova couldn't have done that.

415
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.100
What if someone made that happen?

416
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.700
That's even more impossible.

417
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.200
It's such a large scale.

418
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.400
It was spotted from the observatories in both Beijing and Urumqi.

419
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.600
Do you know what that means?

420
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.300
Can you see this?

421
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.800
Do you get it now?

422
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:46.800
I'm imposing human interference on your observation of this lamp.

423
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.100
This is both theoretically possible and doable.

424
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.200
But what's a cosmic flicker?

425
00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.000
The observation signals received by Beijing and Urumqi observatories are from three observation satellites.

426
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.700
Do you know what that means?

427
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.000
What does it mean?

428
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Let's say this is our earth.

429
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.100
These three are observation satellites.

430
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.900
To make the whole universe flicker with human interference,

431
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.700
theoretically, you need to build a gigantic screen at least

432
00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:22.400
300,000 kilometers wide in a place 150,000 kilometers away from the earth.

433
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.000
Is there science behind your theory?

434
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.500
Science?

435
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.400
You want to talk about science with me?

436
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.400
Considering this scale, Batman and Iron Man can't do it. Even Superman can't do it.

437
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.500
In other words, it's impossible even in sci-fi.

438
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.000
Then what can make it happen?

439
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.400
Mythology!

440
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.200
Zeus should be able to swing it.

441
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.000
It was really not my doing.

442
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.600
I'm a cop.

443
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.000
I had dealings with a lot of criminals.

444
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.300
Criminals experienced things others didn't experience,

445
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.400
so sometimes their mindset is different as well.

446
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.700
Did Professor Ye experience anything unusual?

447
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.400
That's hard to say.

448
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.500
She lived in that era.

449
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.300
She might've been affected.

450
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.300
By the way, the constant and variable thing you talked about a moment ago.

451
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.900
The guy surnamed Schroedinger. Did he have to pick a cat?

452
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.600
Couldn't it be a rabbit, a squirrel, or anything like that?

453
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.200
What is this place?

454
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.600
Our office.

455
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600
Roomy, huh?

456
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.500
Come. Come.

457
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.300
Take a look.

458
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.200
Spotlessly clean.

459
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.900
I brought you here to let you take a closer look and do some research into Ye Wenjie's file.

460
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.800
All right. Where's Professor Ye's file?

461
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.600
Over there.

462
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600
Under the picture of Houyi Shooting Down The Suns.

463
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600
Below the first sun.

464
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.800
Everything here is orderly.

465
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.000
You found it, right?

466
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.800
Yeah.

467
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.200
I'll fill you in while you read those.

468
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:12.800
Ye Wenjie's father was a great scientist, a counter-revolutionary one.

469
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.600
Now he's rehabilitated, of course.

470
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.800
Do you know who ratted on him?

471
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.700
His own daughter.

472
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400
Professor Ye?

473
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.600
No.

474
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.200
Ye Wenjie's little sister.

475
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.300
Her name's Ye Wenxue.

476
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.790
And it gets better than that.

477
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:35.370
Do you know who delivered the decisive blow to him?

478
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.520
His wife. Shao Lin.

479
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.170
Uh, not Shaolin Monastery.

480
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.380
Her surname was Shao. Her given name was Lin.

481
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.900
It's all in here.

482
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.200
I wonder what Ye Wenjie felt at that time.

483
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.400
Ye Wenjie's little sister, Ye Wenxue,

484
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.200
personally had the leader of the campaign take her father away

485
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.900
<i> for interrogation about the ideology embodied in his treatise. 
 [ 1967 ]</i>

486
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.800
<i> In the key phase of the interrogation,</i>

487
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.800
<i> Ye Zhetai's wife, Shao Lin, showed up as well.</i>

488
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.800
<i> Together with Ye Wenxue, they distanced themselves from Ye Zhetai,</i>

489
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.600
<i> which was a terrible blow to him.</i>

490
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.390
<i> Didn't Mother say</i>

491
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.490
<i> that Grandfather and Einstein were close friends?</i>

492
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.440
<i> That they used to discuss science together?</i>

493
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.100
<i> But why are they</i>

494
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.700
<i> beginning to criticize Einstein?</i>

495
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.580
<i> Shao Lin's father</i>

496
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.080
<i> did cross paths with Einstein.</i>

497
00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.780
<i> In 1922,</i>

498
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.010
<i> on Nanjing Road</i>

499
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.400
<i> of Shanghai.</i>

500
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.400
<i> They were walking along the road.</i>

501
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.200
<i> Einstein suddenly asked a young boy smashing stones at the roadside,</i>

502
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.400
<i> how much he earned in a day.</i>

503
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.400
<i> He said five cents.</i>

504
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.800
<i> That was the only time he conversed with the master</i>

505
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.000
<i> who changed the world.</i>

506
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.430
<i> No physics.</i>

507
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.080
<i> No theory of relativity.</i>

508
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.670
<i> Only the hard truth.</i>

509
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.500
<i> Xiao Lin was better than me.</i>

510
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.500
<i> She proved all scientific achievements</i>

511
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:04.240
<i> were the fruits of the people's wisdom.</i>

512
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.800
<i> Those academic authorities of the bourgeoisie</i>

513
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:14.320
<i> just stole the fruits.</i>

514
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.400
<i> There are so many terms in physics.</i>

515
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.600
<i> Will changing the names be enough?</i>

516
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.200
<i> Any brilliant idea</i>

517
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.000
<i> will fall apart eventually.</i>

518
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.600
<i> The gravity of reality</i>

519
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.620
<i> is just too strong.</i>

520
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.550
It never crossed my mind

521
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.750
that Professor Ye had been through something like that.

522
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:12.000
Now I can understand why she took Yang Dong's death so calmly.

523
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.550
But I find it confusing.

524
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.500
By rights, those who have lost a loved one

525
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.700
will definitely cherish familial bonding even more,

526
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.400
but Professor Ye doesn't seem to be like that.

527
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.000
It strikes me that the reason her grief was dissolved

528
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.900
is probably not so simple.

529
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.500
Professor Ye's father was unable to continue his research because of the era.

530
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.500
Professor Ye's daughter, since physics had ceased to exist,

531
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.800
couldn't continue her research either.

532
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.900
Maybe in Professor Ye's eyes, death was a relief to them.

533
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.030
We've never experienced anything like that, so maybe we can't understand it.

534
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.740
No.

535
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.180
Professor Ye didn't have many dealings with Shen Yufei,

536
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.600
but judging from what she said to you,

537
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.600
she's not against the theories of the Frontiers of Science.

538
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.800
Professor Ye's behavior is becoming an increasingly greater mystery to me.

539
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.700
What did she say to you again?

540
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.900
Did she say this was not the first time the scientific community had been in panic?

541
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.400
Yeah.

542
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:24.600
<i> In human history, science caused panic many times.</i>

543
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:32.400
<i> We might be Copernicus, Bruno, or the Church.</i>

544
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.200
<i> Or maybe we're nothing.</i>

545
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.880
Was she asking you to become someone like Copernicus?

546
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.000
Even if I wanted to become Copernicus, aren't I still your undercover agent?

547
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.700
Well, go ahead and become Copernicus.

548
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.400
With me protecting you, I promise you won't get burned alive.

549
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.000
Get burned alive?

550
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
That guy's name's Bruno.

551
00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.000
What about Co-Copernicus?

552
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.900
He died of natural causes.

553
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.900
Well, with me protecting you, I promise you'llâ€¦ be Copernicus.

554
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.600
Thank you.
