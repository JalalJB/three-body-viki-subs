9
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.840
(Tuesday, July 10th, 2007)

10
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.680
Yes.

11
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.650
I had a talk with Shen Yufei.

12
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.730
Talk about what?

13
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.200
Math.

14
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.040
Physics.

15
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.180
Philosophy.

16
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.680
You know we both are members of
the Frontiers of Science, don't you?

17
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.400
Haven't you found out about this?

18
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.680
Yes.

19
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.210
I also found out that
you threatened Wei Cheng.

20
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.520
Wei Cheng.

21
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.960
He's a math lunatic.

22
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.780
He probably thinks that the whole world
wants to persecute him.

23
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.060
You destroyed his computer.

24
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.960
I just tried to stop him from
working on the Three-Body problem.

25
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.210
What he and Shen Yufei did
were meaningless.

26
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.530
You were the last person
Shen Yufei met before she died.

27
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.400
Luckily, she got cameras in her house.

28
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.020
Otherwise,
I would be the suspect.

29
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:08.340
(Tuesday, July 10th, 2007)

30
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.130
Pan Han had left before Shen Yufei died.

31
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.930
She sat alone for a long time,
then shot herself.

32
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.970
The autopsy proved it was suicide.

33
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.870
She saw the truth and made a choice.

34
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.310
You may not understand.

35
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.620
But, there's nothing incomprehensible.

36
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560
Captain Shi, you shouldn't smash this.

37
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.570
The Finance would make you pay for it.

38
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.300
I should have taken the alcohol away.

39
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.600
Don't wake him up.

40
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.660
He has to know it sooner or later.
He's her husband.

41
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.860
Wake up.

42
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.980
Did I make it?

43
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.890
Are you OK?

44
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.890
Here.

45
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.040
There must be something wrong.

46
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.120
I should be able to
find out the problem.

47
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.630
There must be something wrong.

48
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.310
I'm sure I can find...

49
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.370
I should be able to
find out the problem.

50
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.740
I can still calculate.

51
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.510
One hour ago,

52
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.310
(Shen Yufei, Physicist)

53
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.180
she was talking with you.

54
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.190
In an hour, she became a body.

55
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.240
Though I called her an enemy,

56
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.810
I can't bear to see a living person

57
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.770
turn into a body.

58
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.460
Five years ago,

59
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.750
when I was hunting drug dealers
at the China-Myanmar border,

60
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.980
I had a colleague
two years younger than me.

61
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.270
20 minutes ago, he lost
a pack of cigarettes to me in a bet.

62
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.390
In only 20 minutes,

63
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.390
he stepped on a mine
and got blown to smithereens.

64
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.370
I couldn't even retrieve his body.

65
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.460
But I didn't have time to feel sad.

66
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.120
I must strike immediately.

67
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.130
Because if I hadn't kept calm, I or the rest
of us might have been the next to die.

68
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.750
That's the war.

69
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.770
We don't have time to mourn.

70
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.660
So that's why you're becoming
more and more emotionless?

71
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.030
The enemy is more emotionless than us.

72
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.630
Was she the enemy?

73
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.770
Would an enemy kill herself?

74
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.030
That's why the two of us have to
find the answer through investigation.

75
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.740
What exactly happened in the game?

76
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.050
Shen Yufei and I made our last efforts,

77
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.500
only proving that
the Three-Body problem has no solution.

78
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.540
(Mr. Wang: Welcome to attend
the meet-up for Three-Body players.)

79
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.030
(We sincerely invite you
and hope you will arrive on time.)

80
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.840
Meet-up for Three-Body players.

81
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.500
The email came.

82
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.870
Finally.

83
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.540
When?

84
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.890
(Address: Yunhe Theater Time: 19:31)
Tomorrow night.

85
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:05.200
(Yunhe Theater)

86
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.030
Go ahead, Professor Wang.

87
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.410
We don't have time to mourn.

88
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.100
There are not many people, right?

89
00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.720
Perhaps we're early.

90
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.270
I thought people would begin
a lively discussion when they met.

91
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.790
It may because
we work in different areas.

92
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.440
Have you attended to
a meet-up like this before?

93
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.630
My first time.

94
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.440
I'm a reporter.

95
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.890
But I know a little
about the people here.

96
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.000
Is the old man holding a pipe
Mr. Bai, the famous scholar?

97
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.200
Yeah.

98
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.360
He has imbued modern science
with Eastern philosophy.

99
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.700
I benefited a lot interviewing him.

100
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.890
That woman is a famous writer
who just won the Puli Prize.

101
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.870
I've read her book.

102
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.870
She writes in an avant-garde style
and has many readers.

103
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:46.840
Yeah.

104
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.250
You could start
one of her books on any page.

105
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.200
That's a vice president
at China's largest software company.

106
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.840
The one next to him is a high-level executive
at the State Power Corporation.

107
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.910
None of those players who have reached
this level is an average person.

108
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.240
Would you mind telling me

109
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.240
your working field?

110
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.220
I research nanomaterials.
I'm Wang Miao.

111
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.670
I'm a student,

112
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.480
studying for a Ph.D.
in earth management sci-tech.

113
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.960
As I expected,

114
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.000
the people here
are all high-level intellectuals.

115
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.220
We're connected by the game.

116
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.010
Everyone got here early.

117
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.960
You're just like I imagined,
all social elites.

118
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.120
Three-Body is intended
for people in your class

119
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.510
because the common crowd cannot
appreciate its meaning and mood.

120
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.630
(The organizer is Pan Han.)
To play it well requires

121
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.840
knowledge and understanding

122
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.100
that ordinary people do not possess.

123
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.790
Everyone here is an excellent
Three-Body player.

124
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.440
You have the best scores.

125
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.320
I believe that Three-Body has already
become an important part of your lives.

126
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.080
No.

127
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.030
It's part of what keeps me alive.

128
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.320
I saw it by accident
on my grandson's computer.

129
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.000
He abandoned it after a few tries,

130
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.530
saying it was too abstruse.

131
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.550
But that was what attracted me.

132
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.870
Three-Body has very profound mysteries.

133
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.630
(One new message from Shi Qiang)
I find it

134
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.260
(We also see him. No worries. Carry on.)
strange, terrible,

135
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.840
(Play the fanatic in front of them,)

136
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.630
(but not so much that you can't pull it off.)
but also beautiful. It's very logical.

137
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.120
Under the seemingly absurd representation

138
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:28.750
is hidden much information
and amazing data.

139
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:34.200
That's what makes it spectacular

140
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.940
and fascinating.

141
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.670
Exactly.

142
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.750
I like the literary elements
of Three-Body.

143
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.240
The rises and falls of
Three-Body civilizations

144
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.080
are like magnificent epics.

145
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.960
I'm a bit sick of the real world.

146
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.630
Three-Body is already my second reality.

147
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.910
Compared to vulgar reality,

148
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.200
Three-Body is really more fascinating.

149
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.240
It's too bad that it's only a game.

150
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.910
Very good.

151
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.870
I'm glad you have such a consensus.

152
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.370
I have a question that

153
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.010
I think everyone wants to know
the answer to.

154
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.460
Go ahead.

155
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.370
Is Three-Body only a game?

156
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.290
What if the world of Three-Body,
or Trisolaris, really exists?

157
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.050
Then where is it?

158
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.360
Some questions I can answer.

159
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.110
Others I cannot.

160
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.830
But if you are meant to be
with Trisolaris,

161
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:10.550
I believe all your questions
will be answered someday.

162
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:17.400
If Trisolaris does exist,
what do Trisolarans look like?

163
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.480
In every cycle of civilization, the
appearance of Trisolarans is different.

164
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.790
Does the game really
portray Trisolaris accurately?

165
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.830
The ability of Trisolarans to dehydrate through
its many cycles of civilization is real.

166
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.680
In order to adapt to the unpredictable
natural environment,

167
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.270
they can completely expel
the water in their bodies

168
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.640
and turn into dry, fibrous objects.

169
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.240
That's how they avoid extreme environmental
conditions unsuitable for life.

170
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.830
Then, did the Trisolaran-formation computer
also exist on Trisolaris?

171
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.940
Yes.

172
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.000
I thought that was the most unrealistic.

173
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.880
I conducted a test with more than
100 employees at my company.

174
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.790
Even if the idea worked,

175
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.200
a computer made of people

176
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.240
would probably operate at a speed
slower than manual computation.

177
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.920
You're right.

178
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.200
But if of the 30 million soldiers
forming the computer,

179
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.980
each is capable of raising and lowering
the lamps 100,000 times per second,

180
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.880
and if the cavalry on the main bus
can run at several times the speed of sound,

181
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.480
or even faster,
the result would be very different.

182
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.400
You asked about
the appearance of the Trisolarans.

183
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.160
According to some signs,

184
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.790
the bodies of the Trisolarans
who formed the computer

185
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.070
were covered
by a purely reflective surface,

186
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.240
which probably evolved as a response
to survival under extreme

187
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.920
conditions of sunlight.

188
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.000
The mirror-like surface
could be deformed into any shape.

189
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.480
Then, what's the use of deformation?

190
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.480
They could communicate with each other
by focusing light with their bodies.

191
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.480
This kind of light-speech
could transmit information rapidly

192
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.790
and was the foundation
of the Trisolaran-formation computer.

193
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.480
Though it was still
a very inefficient machine,

194
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.310
it could complete calculations
that couldn't be performed manually.

195
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.880
Think about it.

196
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.160
If the computer first appears
as formations of people,

197
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:16.660
before becoming mechanical
and then electronic, isn't it a great idea?

198
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.200
Do the three suns really exist?

199
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.960
Yes, they do.

200
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.790
They're the foundation
of the Trisolaran environment.

201
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.270
The game isn't profitable.

202
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.200
What's the goal of it?

203
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.570
The goal is simple and pure,

204
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.310
to gather those of us
who have common ideals.

205
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.010
What ideals do we have in common?

206
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.500
If Trisolaran civilization does exist,
and they are looking for a new home,

207
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.810
I need to know how you would feel.

208
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.570
Since everyone is

209
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.920
thinking about this question,

210
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:16.590
I think we need to discuss it
with a bit more depth.

211
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:22.550
I want to know your impression
of the Aztecs.

212
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.510
Dark and bloody.

213
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.640
Blood-drenched pyramids

214
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.780
lit by insidious fires
seen through dark forests.

215
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.110
Those are my impressions.

216
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.480
Very good.

217
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.960
Imagine,
if the conquistadors didn't intervene,

218
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.530
what would happen
to this civilization?

219
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.390
You're calling black white.

220
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.510
The conquistadors
who invaded the Americas

221
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.500
were nothing more than
murderers and robbers.

222
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.880
Even so,

223
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.880
at least they prevented the Aztecs from
developing without bound,

224
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.480
turning the Americas into a bloody,
dark great empire.

225
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.960
Then civilization and democracy
in the Americas and the world

226
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.110
wouldn't appear until much later.

227
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.790
Maybe they wouldn't
have appeared at all.

228
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.830
This is the key to the question.

229
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.590
No matter what the Trisolaris is like,

230
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:18.030
its appearance will be
good news for human race.

231
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.440
But have you thought that
the Aztecs were destroyed

232
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.830
by the so-called

233
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.070
advanced Western civilization?

234
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.440
I think the thoughts we're discussing today
are very dangerous.

235
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.660
No.

236
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.660
They're profound!

237
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:52.480
I had the same thought,
but I didn't know how to express it.

238
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.790
You said it so well!

239
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.920
Thanks.

240
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.640
If Trisolaran civilization does exist,

241
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.790
and it needs to find a new home,
I'll be happy.

242
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.270
I hope that it'll come to the earth.

243
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.240
See for yourself.

244
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.440
See what happened over the years.

245
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.880
I'm completely disappointed
with human race.

246
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.270
Human society
has come to a hopeless situation.

247
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.000
We cannot achieve improvement
or evolution by ourselves.

248
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.460
At this time,
we need external forces to reform us.

249
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.050
I agree.

250
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.440
What's human race?

251
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.250
What an ugly thing it is!

252
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:48.750
In the first half of my life,
I've been using literature as a scalpel

253
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.050
to expose such ugliness.

254
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.790
Unfortunately,

255
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:59.700
I'm now tired of exposing it.

256
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.960
I'm yearning for...

257
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.220
I'm yearning for Trisolaran civilization
to bring true beauty to this world.

258
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.310
The other six have all
given their views.

259
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.460
What about you?

260
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.250
I stand with them.

261
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.810
Very good.

262
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.680
The two of you
are no longer welcome at this meet-up,

263
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.030
and you are no longer
appropriate players for Three-Body.

264
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.880
Your IDs will be deleted.

265
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.720
Please leave now.

266
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.880
Thank you for coming.

267
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.050
Please.

268
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.680
Welcome joining
the Earth-Trisolaris Organization.

269
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.050
We are comrades now.

270
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.510
(The Empires of Spain and Portuguese)

271
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.240
Did you spend your time

272
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.090
discussing children's world history
at the meet-up?

273
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.960
The theme was that advanced civilization

274
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.250
would eventually replace
backward civilization.

275
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.400
Where is the advanced civilization?

276
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.240
Trisolaran.

277
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.480
Why is it advanced?

278
00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.480
It can project the countdown on the sun,
on the retina.

279
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.240
And you?

280
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.830
You can only make it into a bomb.

281
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.920
The civilizations we saw in the game
were primitive and backward.

282
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.350
You've played it many times.

283
00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.740
Which of their civilizations
was more advanced than ours?

284
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.920
The destruction of each civilization
would leave fresh experiences and lessons.

285
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.850
The present Civilization No. 192
is almost the same as ours.

286
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.510
If the game continues and
advances to Civilization No. 1,920,

287
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.330
can you imagine
what they will evolve into?

288
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.010
Have you been brainwashed?

289
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.700
Are there really Trisolarans?

290
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.460
Aliens?

291
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.240
Before these things happened, if you had
asked me whether there were aliens,

292
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.570
as a scientist, I would have told you
it was possible, but I wasn't sure.

293
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.290
But now, the countdown
is right in front of my eyes.

294
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.990
Nobody told me the reason.

295
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.810
Nobody could explain it.

296
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.400
The most precise and accurate collider
on the earth was out of order.

297
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.590
Physics no longer exists.

298
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.590
And then someone told me,

299
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.850
I was just a turkey.

300
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.440
The Battle Command Center,

301
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.590
with the most cutting-edge forces
in the world,

302
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.590
couldn't find out
who developed the game.

303
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.290
This game, which couldn't be
developed by turkeys,

304
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.440
showed us the world of the farmer.

305
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.880
Although the game is fictional,
it shows the reason for its existence.

306
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.720
In the game, I witnessed again and again

307
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.030
how civilizations
were reborn from destruction.

308
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.400
It was a miracle to us.
Every reconstruction was a miracle.

309
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.900
But they turned the miracle
into necessity.

310
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.420
Gradually, I began to believe

311
00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.220
there was really
such a planet in the universe.

312
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.830
And now, I'm sure it exists.

313
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.380
Now, if you ask me
whether there are aliens,

314
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.980
I'll say yes with certainty.

315
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.100
They are on a planet
surrounded by three suns.

316
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.290
They have great civilizations
that don't die out.

317
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.530
You were not brainwashed.

318
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.420
I've been brainwashed by your words.

319
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.810
Now I can puzzle out many problems

320
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.990
that I didn't understand before.

321
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.980
Guessing from this perspective,

322
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.250
they are the Lord of Shen Yufei.

323
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.920
So the countdown, universe flicker,

324
00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.740
and scientists' suicide
are all related to them.

325
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.510
Perhaps with their help,

326
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.400
Shen Yufei, Pan Han and Ye Wenjie

327
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.310
could do anything without being caught.

328
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:43.250
They just want to make you
and the other elites become

329
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.060
Trisolarans through
the Frontiers of Science

330
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.590
and the game of Three-Body.

331
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:57.570
You mean the people of the ETO,
Earth-Trisolaris Organization?

332
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:03.350
You call each other comrade?

333
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.240
Common ideals make the same minds.

334
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.920
The same minds make comrades.

335
00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.790
What does that mean?

336
00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.720
Comrades mean those
who have common ideals.

337
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.380
What ideals?

338
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.230
The Three-Body problem has no solution.

339
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.440
The Trisolaris will never have
a precise calendar.

340
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.770
So finding a new home
is their best choice.

341
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.140
Finding a new home?

342
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.030
Yes.

343
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.160
If my house wasn't windproof
or rainproof,

344
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.420
and I couldn't get it repaired,
I would also have to move.

345
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.050
Move?

346
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.220
Where to?

347
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.590
The Trisolarans will be doomed.

348
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.640
How should I put it?

349
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.590
They don't have good geomancy,

350
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.240
or stable foundations,
or good building structures.

351
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.030
They'll definitely move,
and move to the earth,

352
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.110
otherwise, they wouldn't have
asked for so much trouble.

353
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.590
The universe flicker, the countdown,

354
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.510
and all other messy things
were designed for us.

355
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.070
We finally know who our opponent is.

356
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.960
It's better not to know. Aliens. Lord.

357
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.790
That's unbelievable.

358
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.110
The locations of your safe houses
were absolutely a secret,

359
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.480
but they got it in a second.

360
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:33.750
Chang, if nothing else, in the information war,
we'll be defeated completely.

361
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.900
You know that?

362
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.680
Chang, don't worry too much.

363
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.810
Though we can't defeat them,

364
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.330
we should at least call on the turkeys
to stand up and resist them.

365
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.590
Of all the assumptions we made,

366
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.960
this is the last one we want to face.

367
00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.000
The enemy is an alien civilization.

368
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.750
The living conditions on their planet
are very harsh.

369
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.880
They're eager to find a livable planet.

370
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.920
Based on what we know,

371
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.790
their target is probably the earth.

372
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:30.310
Otherwise, we can't explain

373
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.440
why they would infiltrate and

374
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.590
influence the earth at such a level.

375
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.270
If they're a space civilization,

376
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.440
and much more advanced than us,

377
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.590
this will explain a lot of
our previous problems.

378
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.330
I guess at this point,
there's not much we can do.

379
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.680
We don't know when they will come,

380
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.830
or how they will come.

381
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.590
But the ETO probably knows it.

382
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.960
They may also know

383
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.000
what Trisolarans will do when they come.

384
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.310
That's right.

385
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.790
We have to do everything we could
to tackle this organization down.

386
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.960
I hope that
all our sectors around the globe

387
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.030
will unite as one and move together.

388
00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.750
We've always been united.

389
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.550
We've been cooperating
since the beginning,

390
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.920
sharing information with each sector.

391
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:29.550
I mean, this time,
we must really unite as one,

392
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:34.960
trusting each other in the operation,
and being completely transparent.

393
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.160
After tackling the ETO,
with any discovery or progress,

394
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.460
we must share it
with each other in sync.

395
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.420
How was your business trip?

396
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.480
Not bad.

397
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.590
After the meet-up,
Pan Han has been busy.

398
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.760
He met with many members
of the Frontiers of Science.

399
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.480
Today he went to Mu Xing's studio.

400
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.960
- Mu Xing?
- Yes.

401
00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.670
Mu Xing was abroad in the past few days.
She just returned home today.

402
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.400
You didn't go abroad
just for collecting data, did you?

403
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.030
I also interviewed
several foreign scientists,

404
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.190
who I believed were the members
of your organization.

405
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.190
They all believed that Lord would come

406
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.940
to transform human's evil deeds.

407
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.320
I've never lied to you.

408
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.360
I've looked through all their call logs

409
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.030
and checked the time
of Mu Xing's report, based on which,

410
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.320
I can say that Mu Xing
got her information from Pan Han.

411
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.530
So,

412
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.280
do you know Lord?

413
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.280
Captain Shi, do you think that Mu Xing
is also a member of the organization?

414
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.480
Keep an eye on Pan Han.

415
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.610
Yes.

416
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.590
Hello.

417
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.730
I remember you said
you were a master of decryption, right?

418
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.210
I have a favor to ask...

419
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.570
What have you got?

420
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.820
What have you got?

421
00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.380
(Air Pollution in Submarines Causes
Degeneration of Central Nervous System)

422
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.420
(The Harm of Science to the Environment)

423
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.300
Would you like a cup of coffee?

424
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.900
No, water is fine.

425
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.040
On June 14th,

426
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.070
all the observatories around the globe
with proper conditions

427
00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.760
observed the universe flicker.

428
00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.990
But, the reports on this phenomenon
were completely blocked.

429
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:04.130
So, why did the universe flicker?

430
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.780
Did Pan Han give you the information?

431
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.320
Have you found anything about Pan Han?

432
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.760
Of course I have.

433
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.510
As a biologist,
he can give you so much information.

434
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.860
Can you believe that?

435
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.230
I've checked.

436
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.130
He has an organization behind him.

437
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.670
I don't think he only

438
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.100
has one organization behind him.

439
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.000
- Have you got that, too?
- Of course.

440
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.300
What is it?

441
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.150
You tell me.

442
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.690
What have you got?

443
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.590
Behind Pan Han's organization is Lord.

444
00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.940
What is the Lord?

445
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.190
It seems that Pan Han only used you

446
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.690
to run errands for him
and spread gossips.

447
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.050
So what exactly the Lord is?

448
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.880
Let me think.

449
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.570
How can I put it to make you believe?

450
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.590
If I tell you, Lord really exists,

451
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.190
and it will come to the earth
with new ideas, systems

452
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:20.150
and civilizations, will you still think
the process of civilization

453
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:25.420
is to replace the weak with the strong
and the advanced with the backward?

454
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.190
If the Lord

455
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.110
really comes from an alien civilization,

456
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.530
I can accept that.

457
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.980
Aliens, really?

458
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.280
Do you dare to report the news?

459
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.820
Who would believe it?

460
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.150
Even if it's true,

461
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.900
people would think it's a stunt.

462
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.230
All right, let me tell you about
the history of world civilization.

463
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.070
There was once an Aztec Civilization...

464
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.590
I know.

465
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.670
Advanced civilizations
will replace the backward ones.

466
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.670
You know?

467
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.800
That saves me the trouble.

468
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.470
So, who do you stand with?

469
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.730
Do I have a choice?

470
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.010
We are the backward.

471
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.690
We can only wait to be destroyed.

472
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.630
Good.

473
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.840
That's the attitude.

474
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.460
We can cooperate.

475
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.400
You've met with Pan Han a lot recently.

476
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.590
Can you get from him some...

477
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.630
Implant a Trojan Horse in his computer.

478
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.590
Good idea.

479
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.860
Then find a way to get...

480
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.260
What's this?

481
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.710
These are reports
on the universe flicker

482
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.400
observed by the global observatories
at 1:00 AM on June 14th.

483
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.510
(It might be just equipment failure,)

484
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:21.960
(but two or three astronomical
observatories, this region,)

485
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.290
(the whole country,
and we believe the entire world)

486
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:23.670
Hello.

487
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.480
(have observed this strange phenomenon,)

488
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.000
(which is enough to
explain the questions.)

489
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.800
(However, the strangest thing is,)

490
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.480
(this matter has not been
reported by any media so far.)

491
00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:35.960
Yeah.

492
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.760
(It is sole information blockage.)

493
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.440
(Under all the governments' silence,
to obtain all the truth,)

494
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.540
(we came here for a special interview.)

495
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.840
(The file is encrypted.
Enter password to view or edit)

496
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.480
I've implanted a Trojan horse
in his computer.

497
00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.550
(Port)

498
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.050
This is the linker.

499
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.030
Good.

500
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.550
You're efficient.

501
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.670
But, his computer is encrypted.

502
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.000
I can't open it.

503
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.960
Don't worry.

504
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.110
Let me handle it.

505
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.570
We have resources.

506
00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.000
How much has it been deciphered?

507
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.190
There's still 5% to decipher it all.

508
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.550
OK. Hurry up. Time waits for no man!

509
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.550
- The target is deciphered.
- Thanks.

510
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.210
We're in the same boat.

511
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.650
Don't thank me.

512
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.670
The first part is deciphered.

513
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.590
The experts have decoded
a part of the files.

514
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:45.650
They found a list of the names.

515
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:58.010
Confirm them as the ETO,
most located in Europe.

516
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.820
The second part has been decoded.

517
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.670
Have you ever thought that some of them
could actually become one of us?

518
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.550
That might be possible.

519
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.110
But those people
who think they can save the Lord

520
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.760
have never been as pious as
we are in my point to be.

521
00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:26.510
Shen Yufei was once an Adventist,
but still, she was lost,

522
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.960
failed to see
the essence of human nature.

523
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.860
You're taking advantage of human nature.

524
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.840
We'll take care of Europe.

525
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.030
If you find anyone in our sector,
send it to me immediately.

526
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:47.500
I suggest we proceed with unconditional
arrests for all the names on the list.

527
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.230
Seize the time to decipher other files.

528
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.710
Yes.

529
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.360
Once the Battle Command Center
gets the list,

530
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.110
they will be eager to perish them.

531
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.960
It will be a great victory for us.

532
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.280
But Commander isn't on the list.

533
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.550
Because as you said,
Commander doesn't need to choose.

534
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.110
So I don't know which faction
she's standing with.

535
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:13.630
There's another idea I have been
thinking about it for quite a while.

536
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.400
The game was supposed to allow us
to select targets

537
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.760
to have access to
know about the Trisolaris.

538
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.710
But people are absurd.

539
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.360
They always want to be Survivors
that could solve every problem.

540
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:30.710
This I reckon was exactly the very driving force
of the growing Redemptionists faction.

541
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:36.690
So I suggest
shutting down the game servers.

542
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.500
Are you only suggesting?

543
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.570
Dad, I want to watch this.

544
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.670
Do you know what it is about?

545
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.400
Yes. Mom once watched it with me.

546
00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.190
It's about aliens.

547
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.570
Dad, do you think
there are really aliens?

548
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:09.550
Maybe there are.

549
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.400
Maybe there are not.

550
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.860
Is that yes or no?

551
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.070
Maybe there are.

552
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.760
The universe is so vast that it's beyond
our cognition and imagination.

553
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.300
Then will they come to the earth?

554
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.380
Maybe they won't.

555
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.460
Maybe they will.

556
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.960
In front of the universe,
we are all pupils.

557
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:42.550
There are many things to learn.
Just like you, Dad is a pupil, too.

558
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.210
So I can't answer your questions
with 100% certainty.

559
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.650
I'm going to put on the movie.
