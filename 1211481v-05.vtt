Okay?

9
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.230
You dare ride around without insurance?

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.390

15

I heard on the news recently that a policeman was suspended.

Did you... really hear it on the news?

No.

19
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.410
I looked it up.

20
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.100
Looked it up?

21
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.750
Let me introduce myself.

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.270
I work in media.

23
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.940
In new media.

24
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.850
In new media?

25

You can think of me as a... reporter.

I am investigating some events concerning environmental protection.

27
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.960
So, I've noticed what you were doing in the last several days.

28
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.070
I also know it wasn't supposed to be your case.

29
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.320
The reason why you went to the scene is because it has something to do with your current case.

30
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.140
What else do you know?

31
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.880
I know you are investigating the suicides of the scientists'.

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.200
I'm investigating it too.

33
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.870
You can figure out my case and fake an accident.

34
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.440
You are not an average reporter.

35
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.140
I'm a professional little reporter.

36
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.630
Why don't you work with me?

37
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.150
I have lots of information.

38
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.810
I believe that it can help you.

39

You can't get any information out of me.

The policy is in the driving license.

43
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.440
Do you think there are any similarities between their suicides?

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.800
Do you think it was caused by psychological problems or external stimulation?

45
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.890
What's your investigation focus?

46
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.340
Are you going to start from their social relations or research topics?

47

48

Miss Mu, I know you scratched my car by accident.

My car has been scratched many times.

51

Are you Wang Miao?

58
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.090
I'm Professor Ye's student, Sha Ruishan.

59
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.900
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

60
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.160
Are these... all your instruments?

61
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.800
Yeah, they are used for observation, but they have nothing to do with my project.

62
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.860
- Come in. 
 - Okay.

63
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.290
Come.

64
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.620
Aren't they breathtaking?

65
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.460
Unfortunately, they are all like the ears of a deaf man.

66
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.070
Why?

67
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.910
Ever since construction was completed, interference has been unceasing in the observational bands.

68
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.010
First, there were the paging stations during the 80s.

69
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.190
Now, it's mobile communication.

70
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.930
Most of the tasks that need metre-wave aperture synthesis radio telescope can't be performed.

71
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.580
There should be a way to solve it.

72
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.870
Solve it?

73
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.380
Who will solve it?

74
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.430
Should mobile communication be stopped just because we want to explore the universe?

75
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.720
In recent years, commercial operation of basic research have been fairly successful, like in high-energy physics.

76
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.030
Maybe these observatories could be moved to places further away from cities.

77
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.020
It all comes down to money.

78
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.200
Right now, we can only use technical means to shield against interference.

79
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.160
Fortunately, my project only depends on satellite data.

80
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.360
The ground interference doesn't affect me much.

81
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.300
Come on. Let me show you around.

82
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.800
Professor Wang, this is my lab.

83
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.800
It's like home to me. Enjoy yourself.

84
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.970
I usually stay here.

85
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.440
Have some water.

86
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.590
Okay, thanks.

87
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.460
My lab is used to receive the data sent by three satellites

88
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.060
and display them in real time on the eight terminals.

89
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.870
My job is to use this observational data

90
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.800
to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background.

91
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.730
What kind of data do you want to see?

92
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.330
The overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background.

93
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.360
Can you be more specific?

94
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.100
What I mean is the isotropic fluctuation

95
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.200
in the overall cosmic microwave background,

96
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.260
between one and five percent.

97
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.950
Professor Wang, you're not a specialist in the field, right?

98
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.430
No.

99
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.390
Do you have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?

100
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.770
I don't know much.

101
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.310
I think it was back in the 60s when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation

102
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.300
when they were testing a super sensitive satellite reception antenna.

103
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:47.290
The overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background is almost negligible.

104
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.700
Even with the sensitivity of the Planck satellite,

105
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.180
continuously observing for a million years.

106
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.870
But you want to see a five percent fluctuation tonight?

107
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.070
Do you realize what that would mean?

108
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.620
What would that mean?

109
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.350
It means the universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that's about to burn out.

110
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.720
This must be some joke.

111
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.030
I also hope it's just a joke.

112
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.510
Come and look.

113
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.390
Look.

114
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.710
This curve is the measurement of the cosmic microwave background.

115
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.460
After our conversion, it's basically a straight line.

116
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.760
The error range is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the Milky Way.

117
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.000
If the kind of fluctuation you anticipate, in excess of one percent, occurs,

118
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.540
this line would turn red and the fluctuation will show in real time.

119
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:44.050
I would bet that it's going to stay a flat green line until the end of the world.

120
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.240
If you want to see it show the red line of fluctuation,

121
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.670
you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun.

122
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.730
Based on what you said,

123
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.380
it's really unlikely to happen.

124
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.020
But it's alright.

125
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.440
Since Professor Ye asked me to help you, let's do the observation then.

126
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.250
It's not a big deal. Shall we start now?

127
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.320
It might happen around 1:00 AM.

128
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.620
That's soon then.

129
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.830
Take a seat.

130
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.520
Let me set automatic save.

131
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.750
In case, I mean in case, the fluctuation really occurs, it's really worth recording.

132
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.430
I'd rather believe there are aliens than believe the universe would flicker.

133
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.810
Professor Wang.

134
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.120

Look how scared you got.

136
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.430
Would you like some chips?

137
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.080
No, thanks.

138
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.620
Maybe instant noodles or ham sausage?

139
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.140

It must be a mechanical malfunction.

144

It doesn't matter. I have two other satellites.

145

147
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.690
It isn't a malfunction.

148
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.510
Not a malfunction.

149
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.400

150
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.950
Absolutely impossible.

There's another way.

152

and it's still flickering.

225
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.910
Is it possible that the three satellites

226
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.720
and the observatory are all malfunctioning?

227
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.750
Impossible.

228
00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.040
Absolutely impossible.

229
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.280
Is it possible that it's sabotage?

230
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.750
Even more impossible.

231
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.370
To simultaneously alter the data from three satellites and an observatory on Earth?

232
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.040
That's a supernatural saboteur.

233
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.580
Not a ghost of a chance?

234
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.710
Actually, it's really easy to confirm this.

235
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.580
If the cosmic microwave background is fluctuating this much, we should be able to see it with our own eyes.

236
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.530
The wavelength of the cosmic microwave background is seven centimeters.

237
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.450
That's about seven orders of magnitude longer than the wavelength of visible light.

238
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.680
How could we possibly see it?

239
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.780
Using 3K glasses.

240
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.930
What 3K glasses?

241
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.000
<i>The glasses made for Beijing Planetarium.</i>

242
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.680
<i>These glasses can compress the wavelength of the cosmic microwave background</i>

243
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.650
by seven orders of magnitude so that 7 cm waves are turned into visible red lights,

244
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.830
<i>which is the universe flicker we said.</i>

245
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:45.220
<i>If I leave here now, before five o'clock in the morning, can you find me a pair of 3K glasses?</i>

246
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.230
<i>I'll go to Beijing Planetarium alone.</i>

247
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.210
I know.

248
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.360
What I want to say is that you must know a lot of things I don't know.

249
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.830
I hope that you'll explain the truth to me when you feel the time is right.

250
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:04.480
<i>If this phenomenon should lead to some research results, I won't forget you.</i>

251
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.780
The flickering will stop at five in the morning.

252
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.180
You shouldn't pursue it after this.

253
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.350
You won't get anywhere.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.900
I did as she said and the countdown really disappeared.

331
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.500
A trick.

332
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.770
I thought it was a trick at first.

333
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.590
So I told her that I would restart the experiment in three days.

334
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.720
If she could, she should project the countdown onto the sun and the entire universe.

335
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.630
And then?

336
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.350
She did it?

337
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.870
She really did it.

338
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:38.640
She did it exactly at the time and the scale she designated.

339
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.910
I went to the radio astronomical observatory.

340
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.830
I saw the cosmic microwave data.

341
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.680
Then I went to...
- the Beijing Planetarium.

342
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.670
Then I went to the Beijing Planetarium.

343
00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.640
I borrowed a pair of 3K glasses.

344
00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.420
I saw the entire universe was flickering...

345
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.960
flickering for me.

346
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.930
You're saying... that the universe was winking at you?

347
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.380
It was exactly the same as the countdown in my eyes.

348
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.970
Bullshit.

349
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.320
It's true.

350
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.830
I saw it. Sha Ruishan saw it.

351
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.410
The Urumqi Observatory recorded it.

352
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.540
More bullshit.

353
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.540
Shi Qiang,

354
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.010
do you ever considered certain philosophical questions?

355
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.870
Where do we come from?

356
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.560
Where will we go?

357
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.200
Where does the universe come from and where will it go?

358
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.020
Nope.

359
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.100
Never?

360
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.780
Never.

361
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.240
The sesame paste is too salty.

362
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.660
When you look at the stars,

363
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.340
don't you feel curious and awe at all?

364
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.020
I never look at the sky at night.

365
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.860
Don't you often work the night shift?

366
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:16.750
Buddy, when I work at night, if I look up at the sky, the suspect is going to escape.

367
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.660
We really have nothing to say to each other.

368
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.240
You know what, even if I had time to look at the stars and the moon,

369
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.400
I wouldn't be thinking about your philosophical questions.

370
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.820
I have too much to worry about.

371
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.620
I gotta pay the mortgage.

372
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.010
My child hasn't found a job.

373
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.560
And the endless stream of cases...

374
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.730
I tell you what,

375
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.390
I'm such a simple man that if you look down my throat, you can see out my ass.

376
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.770
Naturally, I'm not that kind of person bosses would like.

377
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.420
Years after being discharged from the army, my career is going nowhere.

378
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:01.350
If I weren't pretty good at my job, I would have been kicked out a long time ago.

379
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.480
Where would I get the time to gaze at stars and philosophize?

380
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:08.140
Have you heard of the shooter hypothesis and the farmer hypothesis?

381
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.740
Nope.

382
00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.900
Right now you're a 2-D creature inhabiting the surface of the target, or a turkey on a farm.

383
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.310
You're mocking me.

384
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.000
I can tell that.

385
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.700
Though I know nothing about the hypothesis you referred to,

386
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.690
I do know an ultimate rule,

387
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:30.100
which is, anything sufficiently weird must be fishy.

388
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.470
There's a reason to pull leather pants on cotton-padded pants.

389
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.310
Either the latter is too thin or the former is without fur.

390
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.550
What kind of crappy rule is that?

391
00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.540
What crap?

392
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.190
There's always someone behind things that don't have an explanation.

393
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.110
It's not a person!

394
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.230
If you had a little basic knowledge of science,

395
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.690
you'd know it's impossible for any force to accomplish the things I experienced.

396
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.770
A countdown was displayed at the scale of the universe!

397
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.030
You can't explain it with our current science!

398
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.570
I couldn't even imagine how to explain it outside of science!

399
00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:56.620
It's more than supernatural!

400
00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.030
It's super, I don't know what...!

401
00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.600
Either way, I'm telling you, bullshit.

402
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.430
I've seen plenty of weird things.

403
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.200
But I really want to know what will happen at the end of the countdown.

404
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.310
What can it be?

405
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.610
What can it be?

406
00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.390
The destruction of earth?

407
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.440
Humans dying out?

408
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.590
Or physics no longer existing?

409
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.840
Human science no longer existing? So what?

410
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:28.240
Human returns to the agrarian society, or even the primitive society.

411
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.280
We have to bore wood to get fire, farm and hunt. So what?

412
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.410
Our ancestors lived in that way.

413
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:35.100
We can also live in that way, right?

414
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.060
I know you want to comfort me.

415
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:59.610
If you didn't think it was important, you wouldn't have followed me all this time, right?

416
00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.080
The end of the countdown will never be a simple degradation.

417
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.110
What exactly will happen?

418
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:13.130
What is it that we must face?

419
00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:14.960
Why do they want to destroy our science?

420
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.200
Apart from our science, what else will they destroy?

421
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.010
I'm right about you.

422
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.970
It was a compliment when I said you don't dare kill yourself.

423
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.530
All right. Let's eat.

424
00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.330
And then we go.

425

Go where?

426
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.710
I'll send you home so that you can get some sleep.

427

After sleeping?

428
00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.090
You'll have dinner, and then have some drinks.

429
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.150
And then get more sleep.

430
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.340
And then?

431
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.630
And then, you'll have to work the next day.

432
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.130
There are only 1,103 hours left before the end of the countdown.

433

Wang Miao, I tell you what, your first priority is to stand up straight and not collapse into a heap.

435
00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.630
Only then can we talk about other things.

436
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.960
Shi Qiang, can you tell me something about what's really going on?

437
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.290
I'm begging you.

438
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.810
What you just asked me,

439
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.990
I've asked Chang Weisi several times.

440
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.460
We're in the same boat, you and I.

441
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.610
I'll be honest with you.

442
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.720
I don't know anything.

443
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.800
At least in the Battle Command Center, I'm a turkey.

444
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.630
Do you know what turkey represents?

445
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.150
Nope.

446
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.230
But I do know, the harder they try to scare you with something,

447
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.230
the less you should let them satisfy their desires.

448

Right now they're targeting you.

449

Dad.

Dad.

505
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.230
The teacher asked me again.

506
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:08.800
Are you going to come give the lecture at my school?

507
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.530
What lecture?

508
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.590
I told you the other day.

509
00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.330
You are a professor of physics.

510
00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:20.920
My teacher wants you to give us a lecture at school.

511
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.950
Physics?

512
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.300
Dad.

513
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.620
Please say yes.

514
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.710
Say yes.

515
00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.800
Who can catch this ball?

516
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.840
Me. Me. Me!

517
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.080
- Professor, me.
- Me. - Me.
[ Charm of Physics ]

518
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.030
Professor, I can catch it!

519
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.460
Professor, me, me.

520
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.680
Okay, now I have a question for you.

521
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:58.860
Why does the ball always hit the ground no matter how high I throw it?

522
00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.840
Gravity.

523
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.870
Very good.

524
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.750
You are all very smart.

525
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:07.950
This is the truth of physics.

526
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:12.700
It reveals the nature of all things in the world and the laws of movement,

527
00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.210
and explores the mysteries of nature.

528
00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:18.730
Physics will tell you all the answers.

529
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.560
According to calculations, using this rule,

530
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.300
we have a probability of about 3.22% to reduce the costs.

531
00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.550
And we may also solve the problem around Nano Flying Blade not being able to go into mass production.

532
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.480
Now the shutdown and maintenance are over.

533
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.280
I declare,

534
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.930
the experiment is restarting.

535
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.240
This is the tennis ball we just threw.

536
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.780
This is an iron ball.

537
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.820
If we release them at the same height

538
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.570
and the same time, which will hit the ground first?

539
00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.150
- Tennis ball.
- Iron ball.

540
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.900
Okay.

541
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:58.010
Now let's count one, two, three, and see which will hit the ground first.

542
00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.840
Mr. Wang, everything is ready.

543
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.700
The experiment can restart in two hours.

544
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.830
One!

545
00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.490
Two!

546
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.720
three!

547
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:42.820
Get ready to restart.

548
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:09.030
As you saw, they hit the ground at the same time.

549
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.440
This is physics.

550
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.210
It isn't based on imagination or speculation.

551
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:20.190
We need to conduct experiments down to earth, one experiment after another.

552
00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:25.080
Our experiments may fail, but we shouldn't give up.

553
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:31.180
Like when you were little, you had to learn to walk, ride a bike, and skate.

554
00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.370
What would you do if you fell down accidentally?

555
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:38.570
Stand up!

556
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.970
Very good!

557
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:44.690
You won't stop moving forward just because you are afraid of falling.

558
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:49.890
<i>Of course, it will never be easy to pursue the truth.</i>

559
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.260
<i>You'll face setbacks</i>

560
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.320
<i>and suspicion.</i>

561
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.550
But whether Giordano Bruno

562
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.590
or Galileo,

563
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:09.470
history has eventually proved that their adherence to the truth is incomparably correct.

564
00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.570
Let's stick to our intention of pursuing truth

565
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.150
and never give up.

566
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.490
<i>[1027  07  56... 55, 54, 53]</i>

567
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:41.220
<i>[1023  08  03... 02, 01, 00]</i>

568
00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.190
What's this?

569
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.150
Look carefully.

570
00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:36.990
Look in the middle.

571
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:38.600
What's this?

572
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.550
Countdown.

573
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.820
Dr. Ding.

574
00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.670
Dr. Ding.

575
00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.230
Stay back.

576
00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:24.960
Stay back.

577
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.730
In 1975,

578
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:46.890
Victor, the scientist, used a high-energy electron accelerator collider to verify his model.

579
00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.140
But he failed.

580
00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.480
Then he stayed there for over four hours to check all the components,

581
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.560
and eventually found that his calculation was incorrect.

582
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.260
So are you paying tribute to Victor now?

583
00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.140
The first data at 9:07,

584
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.800
the second data at 10:22,

585
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.230
and the third data at 10:50 are inconsistent.

586
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.870
Neither are they consistent with the calculation.

587
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.030
The experiment failed.

588
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.070
I saw all the data.

589
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:24.420
I think at most, the verification hasn't been completed. It isn't a failure.

590
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.960
But I didn't find any regular patterns.

591
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.770
This kind of problem happens in most experiments.

592
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:42.440
If it were me, I would find various excuses.

593
00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:47.260
Maybe... my outfit today...

594
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.220
wasn't right.

595
00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.500
Or maybe I shouldn't have had that cup of coffee.

596
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.430
Or maybe I shouldn't have played that music during when bathing last night?

597
00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.530
I think you should think about it in this way.

598
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.810
Maybe you left home too early this morning.

599
00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.800
Maybe you didn't wear the perfume I gave you.

600
00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.180
Maybe...

601
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:18.500
the experiment will go smoothly if you say yes to my proposal.

602
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.590
You should know,

603
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.550
every time when we get inaccurate data,

604
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:32.370
it means the theoretical models become more and more complex, vague, and uncertain.

605
00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:37.190
Experimental verification will become more and more difficult.

606
00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.480
Then measure it more times.

607
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.420
And I'll propose more times.
